  '\nI picked this game up in early access a few weeks ago and I’ve put a lot of time in to it. It’s a non-violent Pokémon meets Animal Crossing game with some of my favorite dialog in a game since Night in the Woods. While the game is unfinished and there are a few bugs, it’s still incredibly fun and I can’t wait to see where this game goes.\n'
