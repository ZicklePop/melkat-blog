  "\nI don't think I ever introduced my software company, [Girlfriend Technology](https://girlfriend.technology), on this blog.\n\nGirlfriend Technology is a software company I started to distribute apps under. My goal is to build apps that can benefit queer people, or at least think of them first instead of as an afterthought.\n\nMy app, [X to Y](https://girlfriend.technology/x-to-y), stemmed from a former employer not allowing me to change my name at work to be my *legal* name. I got tired of seeing my deadname and made my own personal browser extension to fix it.\n\nX to Y got a nice update last week to allow it to play nice on webpages with dynamic content. The next update will help with backing up and restoring preferences.\n"
