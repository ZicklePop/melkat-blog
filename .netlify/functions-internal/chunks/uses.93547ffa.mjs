  "Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech), I have written up my current setup. I will try to keep this post updated as things change.\n\n\n## Hardware\n\n### The Bedrock\n\n- [Bamboo Motion-X Board by UPLIFT Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/bamboo-motion-x-board-by-uplift-desk/)\n- [Blue Steelcase Gesture Office Chair](https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/gesture/)\n- [Everlasting Comfort Office Foot Rest](https://smile.amazon.com/Foot-Rest-Under-Desk-Footstool/dp/B07PGLBCFG)\n- [Office Owl Caster Wheels for Desk Chairs](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JPXXK4C/)\n- [Supercope Cup Holder Clip](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FSDZN1Y/)\n- [UPLIFT Bamboo Standing Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-bamboo-standing-desk/) \n- [UPLIFT Big Standard Keyboard Tray - Bamboo with Quick Adjust Mechanism](https://www.upliftdesk.com/big-standard-keyboard-bamboo-tray-system-by-uplift-desk/)\n\n\n### Computers\n\n- iPad Pro - This is my main machine, to be honest. I use it for everything, yes even coding.\n- Custom PC - This is my default desk experience when I am not working. I enjoy the new Windows 11.\n- MacBook Pro - I basically just use this for work, building the iOS/macOS builds of my apps, or Facetime.\n- Surface Pro 6 - I picked up the Surface a while back and it still runs great and is a quick portable way to bring a Windows machine with me. It's great for low spec gaming too.\n\n\n### The Input Club\n\n- [Blue Portico75 Keyboard](https://thekey.company/collections/in-stock/keyboards) - A 75% keyboard with a knob and a USB-C port.\n\t- [Drop + Mito Keysterine Cyanide Keycap Set](https://drop.com/buy/keysterine-keycap-set?defaultSelectionIds=965918) - Translucent keycaps that match the blue Portico75.\n\t- [SP-Star Marble Soda Original switches](https://thekey.company/collections/in-stock/products/sp-star-marble-soda-switches) Blue linear switches that are quiet enough and match the translucent blue of the Portico75 and Keysterine keycaps.\n- [Kensington VeriMark USB Fingerprint Key](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAVWPOJ) - This is finicky but when it works it's pretty cool.\n- [Kone XP](https://www.roccat.com/products/kone-xp) - I wanted to try out a gaming mouse and this seemed like the perfect place to start. It's light and has automatic profile switching between apps and games.\n- [Logitech MX Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005178.html) - I learned during quarantine that my hand starts to hurt after long periods of using a regular mouse. The MX Vertical is great but I've wanted to try a trackball mouse for a while.\n- [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) - The answer to the question, \"omg where is the hang up button on Zoom?!\" It's right there, on a physical button.\n\n\n### The Audio Video Club\n\n- [Alienware 34\" 120Hz Ultrawide Monitor - AW3420DW](https://smile.amazon.com/Alienware-Curved-NVIDIA-Edgelight-Monitor/dp/B07YLGH9Q5) - Not a fan of Alienware, but I fell in love with the ultrawide form factor and wanted something that could handle high framerates.\n- [Audio-Technica AT2020 XLR Microphone](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H92QK/)\n- [Behringer UMC204HD Audio Interface](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0BK0)\n- [FiiO BTR5 Bluetooth and USB-C DAC](https://www.fiio.com/btr5) - No headphone jack on the iOS devices anymore, so lets add it back through Bluetooth.\n- [Hatsune Miku Edition TASCAM VL-S3BT Speakers](https://tascam.com/us/product/vl-s3/)\n- [Opal C1](https://opalcamera.com) - This camera is pretty slick and in early beta. I hope to one day use it with Windows as well as Mac. As of this writing it runs 105°F when it's not in use, the software is lacking, and it only works in Zoom and Chrome.\n- [Pokémon Center × Grado Labs Pikachu Headphones](https://gradolabs.com/pokemon) - Thic cable, amazing sound, wearing all day leads to them getting a little uncomfortable, but they have a Pikachu on them so it's five stars all around. And hey, approved by [DankPods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk-Tybi-ihw 'YouTube Video: The DankPods Headphone Starter Guide.').\n- [RAZER Kiyo Camera w/ Ring Light](https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo) - Not a fan of Razer, but it solved a lighting issue for me. Where I cannot use the Opal C1, I will use this camera.\n- [Samson SR850 Headphones](https://smile.amazon.com/Samson-SR850-Semi-Open-Back-Reference-Headphones/dp/B002LBSEQS) with [Brainwavz Cooling Gel Earpads](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SBT93R9/) - Long cable, amazing sound, and with the replacement earpads they are the most comfortable headphones I own. Great for all day wear. Also recommended by [DankPods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk-Tybi-ihw 'YouTube Video: The DankPods Headphone Starter Guide.')!\n\n\n## Software\n\n### Multiplatform\n\n- [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Use a password manager. Use unique passwords. Use two-factor auth. Just do it, already.\n- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) - A full Illustrator experience on all of my devices, even iPad. No subscription fees.\n- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - A full Photoshop experience on all of my devices, even iPad. No subscription fees.\n- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) - Not available on Windows. Fantastical merges a variety of calendars and todo lists together with custom views and natural language processing.\n- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) - Another Chromium based browser but without all the Google stuff. Tab napping to save resources on tabs you aren't using is a huge plus.\n- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - A customizable library of Markdown files you can optionally apply end-to-end encryption to and sync.\n- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A fast and reliable code editor that is extendible. Runs on any platform either natively or in the web browser.\n\n\n### iOS\n\n- [Blink Shell](https://blink.sh/) - SSH and Mosh support, now with the ability to mount SSH connections to the Files app, and the ability to launch VS Code.\n- [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) - Keeping a journal is a rewarding way to see how far you've come and remember important events in your life.\n- [Inspect Browser](https://apps.pdyn.net/inspect/) - Inspect Element for iOS, not as full featured but the best and most reliable I've found.\n- [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) - Old reliable code editor. It's no VS Code, but it's pretty good for prototyping HTML or JavaScript.\n- [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) - Git on iOS and it works with other apps.\n\n\n### Windows 11\n\n- [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) - There are so many features in here I love but I use FancyZones the most to move windows around in predetermined positions on my screen.\n- [Velocity](https://velocity.silverlakesoftware.com/) - This is like Dash for Mac but on Windows. It stores a variety of documentation for programming offline where you can easily search it for what you're looking for.\n\n\n### macOS\n\n- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Quickly perform tasks, find apps and files, and manage your clipboard history.\n- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) - Everyone wants to be in the macOS menu bar. Hide those distractions.\n- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) - Stores coding documentation offline where you can search it for what you're looking for.\n- [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) - Monitors files and performs actions when certain conditions are met.

Oh it's probably just Docker. I hate it when Docker eats all available resources when it's idle.\n- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) - A terminal that I can split the views in half vertically or horizontally. I swear I don't use most of what this offers.\n- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) - Set up custom actions on your Mac. I use it to extend what my Steam Deck can do.\n- [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) - This is also primarily for the Steam Deck so I can play my annoying soundboard during work meetings.\n- [Shush](https://mizage.com/shush/) - This app hasn't been updated in sooooo long and I fear for the day it stops working. It's a great way to toggle the mute on your microphone or have a cough button.\n\n\n## Customizations\n\n* Color scheme: [Dracula Pro](https://draculatheme.com/pro)\n* Font: [Cartograph](https://connary.com/cartograph.html)\n* [My dotfiles are available on Github](https://github.com/zicklepop/dotfiles)\n\n\n## VS Code Extensions\n\n- [change-case](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case) - There is nothing like a handy way to convert which case your text or variables are. \n- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - Never spend another hour trying to debug code that would work if didn't make that typo.\n- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) - This pair programmer's inteligence is like magic, but it does pay to keep an eye on it so it stays on track.\n- [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) - Create and review PRs without having to find what your looking for in GitHub.\n- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) - Invite someone you trust to code along side you each from the comfort of each other's own VS Code.\n- [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) - I use this for connecting to a Windows Subsystem for Linux quite often, but it's also great for working over SSH.\n- [Sort lines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.sort-lines) - Like casing, there's nothing like a quick way to remove duplicates from a list and sort it at the same time.\n- [Turbo Console Log](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log) - Highlight text and press a keyboard shortcut to have your own easy to find console log.
