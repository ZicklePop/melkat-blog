I might not, but a lot of these apps have been with me for a long time.\n\nI do want to comment on how I listed the prices: the cost to avoid subscriptions is what I listed. Some of these apps are free, and you may not need to pay for them, or you could pay less, but I thought it was important to set expectations up front.\n"
