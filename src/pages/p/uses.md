Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech), I have written up my current setup. I will try to keep this post updated as things change.


## Hardware

### The Bedrock

- [Bamboo Motion-X Board by UPLIFT Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/bamboo-motion-x-board-by-uplift-desk/)
- [Blue Steelcase Gesture Office Chair](https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/gesture/)
- [Everlasting Comfort Office Foot Rest](https://smile.amazon.com/Foot-Rest-Under-Desk-Footstool/dp/B07PGLBCFG)
- [Office Owl Caster Wheels for Desk Chairs](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JPXXK4C/)
- [Supercope Cup Holder Clip](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FSDZN1Y/)
- [UPLIFT Bamboo Standing Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-bamboo-standing-desk/) 
- [UPLIFT Big Standard Keyboard Tray - Bamboo with Quick Adjust Mechanism](https://www.upliftdesk.com/big-standard-keyboard-bamboo-tray-system-by-uplift-desk/)


### Computers

- iPad Pro - This is my main machine, to be honest. I use it for everything, yes even coding.
- Custom PC - This is my default desk experience when I am not working. I enjoy the new Windows 11.
- MacBook Pro - I basically just use this for work, building the iOS/macOS builds of my apps, or Facetime.
- Surface Pro 6 - I picked up the Surface a while back and it still runs great and is a quick portable way to bring a Windows machine with me. It's great for low spec gaming too.


### The Input Club

- [Blue Portico75 Keyboard](https://thekey.company/collections/keyboards/products/portico75-clear) - A 75% keyboard with a knob and a USB-C port.
	- [Drop + Mito Keysterine Cyanide Keycap Set](https://drop.com/buy/keysterine-keycap-set?defaultSelectionIds=965918) - Translucent keycaps that match the blue Portico75.
	- [SP-Star Marble Soda Original switches](https://thekey.company/collections/in-stock/products/sp-star-marble-soda-switches) Blue linear switches that are quiet enough and match the translucent blue of the Portico75 and Keysterine keycaps.
- [Kensington VeriMark USB Fingerprint Key](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAVWPOJ) - This is finicky but when it works it's pretty cool.
- [Kone XP](https://www.roccat.com/products/kone-xp) - I wanted to try out a gaming mouse and this seemed like the perfect place to start. It's light and has automatic profile switching between apps and games.
- [Logitech MX Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005178.html) - I learned during quarantine that my hand starts to hurt after long periods of using a regular mouse. The MX Vertical is great but I've wanted to try a trackball mouse for a while.
- [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) - The answer to the question, "omg where is the hang up button on Zoom?!" It's right there, on a physical button.


### The Audio Video Club

- [Alienware 34" 120Hz Ultrawide Monitor - AW3420DW](https://smile.amazon.com/Alienware-Curved-NVIDIA-Edgelight-Monitor/dp/B07YLGH9Q5) - Not a fan of Alienware, but I fell in love with the ultrawide form factor and wanted something that could handle high framerates.
- [Audio-Technica AT2020 XLR Microphone](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H92QK/)
- [Behringer UMC204HD Audio Interface](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0BK0)
- [FiiO BTR5 Bluetooth and USB-C DAC](https://www.fiio.com/btr5) - No headphone jack on the iOS devices anymore, so lets add it back through Bluetooth.
- [Hatsune Miku Edition TASCAM VL-S3BT Speakers](https://tascam.com/us/product/vl-s3/)
- [Opal C1](https://opalcamera.com) - This camera is pretty slick and in early beta. I hope to one day use it with Windows as well as Mac. As of this writing it runs 105°F when it's not in use, the software is lacking, and it only works in Zoom and Chrome.
- [Pokémon Center × Grado Labs Pikachu Headphones](https://gradolabs.com/pokemon) - Thic cable, amazing sound, wearing all day leads to them getting a little uncomfortable, but they have a Pikachu on them so it's five stars all around. And hey, approved by [DankPods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk-Tybi-ihw 'YouTube Video: The DankPods Headphone Starter Guide.').
- [RAZER Kiyo Camera w/ Ring Light](https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo) - Not a fan of Razer, but it solved a lighting issue for me. Where I cannot use the Opal C1, I will use this camera.
- [Samson SR850 Headphones](https://smile.amazon.com/Samson-SR850-Semi-Open-Back-Reference-Headphones/dp/B002LBSEQS) with [Brainwavz Cooling Gel Earpads](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SBT93R9/) - Long cable, amazing sound, and with the replacement earpads they are the most comfortable headphones I own. Great for all day wear. Also recommended by [DankPods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk-Tybi-ihw 'YouTube Video: The DankPods Headphone Starter Guide.')!


## Software

### Multiplatform

- [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Use a password manager. Use unique passwords. Use two-factor auth. Just do it, already.
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) - A full Illustrator experience on all of my devices, even iPad. No subscription fees.
- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - A full Photoshop experience on all of my devices, even iPad. No subscription fees.
- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) - Not available on Windows. Fantastical merges a variety of calendars and todo lists together with custom views and natural language processing.
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) - Another Chromium based browser but without all the Google stuff. Tab napping to save resources on tabs you aren't using is a huge plus.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - A customizable library of Markdown files you can optionally apply end-to-end encryption to and sync.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A fast and reliable code editor that is extendible. Runs on any platform either natively or in the web browser.


### iOS

- [Blink Shell](https://blink.sh/) - SSH and Mosh support, now with the ability to mount SSH connections to the Files app, and the ability to launch VS Code.
- [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) - Keeping a journal is a rewarding way to see how far you've come and remember important events in your life.
- [Inspect Browser](https://apps.pdyn.net/inspect/) - Inspect Element for iOS, not as full featured but the best and most reliable I've found.
- [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) - Old reliable code editor. It's no VS Code, but it's pretty good for prototyping HTML or JavaScript.
- [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) - Git on iOS and it works with other apps.


### Windows 11

- [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) - There are so many features in here I love but I use FancyZones the most to move windows around in predetermined positions on my screen.
- [Velocity](https://velocity.silverlakesoftware.com/) - This is like Dash for Mac but on Windows. It stores a variety of documentation for programming offline where you can easily search it for what you're looking for.


### macOS

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Quickly perform tasks, find apps and files, and manage your clipboard history.
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) - Everyone wants to be in the macOS menu bar. Hide those distractions.
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) - Stores coding documentation offline where you can search it for what you're looking for.
- [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) - Monitors files and performs actions when certain conditions are met. For example, I have a folder of Markdown files that will automatically commit itself to a Git repository when there are changes.
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) - Please don't throw images up online without making sure their file size is as small as it can be without reducing image quality.
- [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) - What company spyware is causing my Mac to be so slow? Oh it's probably just Docker. I hate it when Docker eats all available resources when it's idle.
- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) - A terminal that I can split the views in half vertically or horizontally. I swear I don't use most of what this offers.
- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) - Set up custom actions on your Mac. I use it to extend what my Steam Deck can do.
- [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) - This is also primarily for the Steam Deck so I can play my annoying soundboard during work meetings.
- [Shush](https://mizage.com/shush/) - This app hasn't been updated in sooooo long and I fear for the day it stops working. It's a great way to toggle the mute on your microphone or have a cough button.


## Customizations

* Color scheme: [Dracula Pro](https://draculatheme.com/pro)
* Font: [Cartograph](https://connary.com/cartograph.html)
* [My dotfiles are available on Github](https://github.com/zicklepop/dotfiles)

- [Turbo Console Log](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log) - Highlight text and press a keyboard shortcut to have your own easy to find console log. Each log is easily identifiable with an emoji, file name, and line number.

- [Noir](https://getnoir.app/) - My preferred extension for applying dark mode to websites that haven't implemented their own dark modes yet.
- [Vinegar](https://andadinosaur.com/launch-vinegar) - Replaces YouTube video players with one that supports picture-in-picture and stops that annoying auto-play. (use with Baking Soda to make all video players play nice)
