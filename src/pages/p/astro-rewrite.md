Welcome to the blog that was known as [melkat.link](https://melkat.link).

I had a fun technique for making a blog using a bookmarking service to act as my content management system. I never knew how the bookmarking service felt about how I was using it and it made my blog on external services.

A few months ago I heard about [Astro](https://astro.build), a new build tool for building websites in JavaScript. I've since made a few sites using it and have been pretty impressed. Before I was using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and I will continue to use it where appropriate.

The biggest change will be that I can no longer simply share a link to post on my blog. I will need to write a brand new [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file and deploy it, which brings it's own set of benefits. For one, I can now write posts like this.

See you soon~
