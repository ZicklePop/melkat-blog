These days I often hear some bozo who thinks the web is just a few social media websites claim the internet is dying. Visit another website, I'm begging you! There's so much good stuff out there.

- [How social networks prey on our longing to be known by Jan Maarten](https://janmaarten.com/polywork/)   
   "To be online today is to constantly walk a tight-rope between the longing to be known and the dread of being perceived."  
- [Engineering for Slow Internet – brr](https://brr.fyi/posts/engineering-for-slow-internet)   
   You mean data doesn't magically get smaller just because it's cold in Antarctica?
- [Fake “Balatro Mobile” appears on the App Store - Wavelengths](https://wavelengths.online/posts/fake-balatro-mobile-appears-on-the-app-store)   
   The scam is still up, even now, thanks to our friends at Apple.
- [I have never seen that level of deliberate cruelty by Luke O'Neil](https://www.welcometohellworld.com/untitled-6/)   
   "We should not have ever been made able to know how fucking stupid and evil so many random regular people are. You used to just have to kind of eyeball things big picture-wise and convince yourself it wasn't all as bad as it seems but now we can see the results come in with hourly certainty. Doesn't feel good."  
- [Apple Annie’s Weblog · Adding a ShareOpenly link to weblog posts.](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/05/adding-a-shareopenly-link-to-weblog-posts)   
   I use the Web Share API for share links on my blog, but the support for that feels hit or miss among different browsers and OSs. So, thanks to Apple Annie's post for getting me to use ShareOpenly as a pretty good fallback.
- [When will Apple focus on Safari? by Mayank](https://www.mayank.co/blog/safari-focus/)   
   I didn't know that Apple broke tabbing on websites on purpose, I thought it was either a bug or user error, but no! You have to hold the option key while tabbing for it to work by default.
- [How Optical Mice Came To Dominate Input Devices](https://tedium.co/2024/05/19/optical-mouse-history-evolution/)   
   A fun history of the mouse.  
- [Complicated Sticks by Faster and Worse](https://fasterandworse.com/complicated-sticks/)   
   "Browse the web sites of Notion, Figma, or Slack—check the celebratory discourse around OpenAI, Midjourney, Ethereum, or Bitcoin—look at the promotional material for the Apple Watch, the Vision Pro, the iPad—and you won’t find any assertions more specific than abstract claims of creativity, collaboration, health, wealth, or productivity."  
- [If Kevin Roose Was ChatGPT With A Spray-On Beard, Could Anyone Tell? from Defector](https://defector.com/if-kevin-roose-was-chatgpt-with-a-spray-on-beard-could-anyone-tell)   
   Uncritical eyes from tech journalists will harm a lot of people. 
- [Little Kitty, Big City Does Everything It Needed To Do - Aftermath](https://aftermath.site/little-kitty-big-city-cat-game-impressions)   
   I love this game. This is one of the best games.
