Every day there is a new read later app, despite most of them being the same. I started my paid email newsletter journey by using my [Feedbin address](https://feedbin.com/blog/2024/04/25/custom-newsletter-addresses/) as my login address, but that never sat right with me, so I changed it to my primary email address and then set up my email to forward emails from addresses to read later apps. This was fine until newsletters stopped having consistent from addresses. Then I stopped wanting them to go to one read later service for another. This was painful to keep up with.

Like most people who have their own domain name, I have too many domain names. So I took one that I wasn't using and set it up with [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net) which allows you to create email aliases that forward emails to other addresses. So I set up two aliases: `read-later@` forwards to my personal address and to whatever read later services I want, and `should-have-been-an-rss-feed@` for newsletters that are less important and only forwards to a few feed readers, like Feedbin. Now my newsletters go where I want them to and I only have to change things in one spot.
