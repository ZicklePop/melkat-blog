The world of newsletters has both exploded and imploded in the last few years. I'm fairly new to the scene myself. After trying a bunch over the last year or so, here are the ones I like that I find insightful.


## Humorism

by Seth Simons, [humorism.xyz](https://www.humorism.xyz)
> Humorism is a newsletter about labor, inequality, and extremism in comedy

Humorism [introduced me to Joe Pera](https://www.humorism.xyz/discussing-slow-and-steady-with-joe-pera/) and keeps me informed about which [comedians are trying to kill me](https://www.humorism.xyz/call-dave-chappelle-an-anti-trans-activist/) and which are [actually funny](https://www.humorism.xyz/humor-is-a-great-way-to-start-conversations/). Some of the stuff about transphobia I found [utterly repulsive](https://www.humorism.xyz/censor-yourself/), but now I know who not to watch, which is a plus.


## Welcome to Hell World

by Luke O’Neil, [welcometohellworld.com](https://www.welcometohellworld.com)
> “Luke O’Neil’s Welcome To Hell World is a vital and despairing collection of essays on modern American life.” — Longreads

I'm not going to sugarcoat things, and neither is Luke. Some of his articles made me cry for hours. One of the articles that will stay with me forever is the one where he interviewed [people who had to make the decision to pull the plug on their parents.](https://www.welcometohellworld.com/we-agonized-over-the-decision-of-whether-or-not-to-kill-my-father/) It's brutal. I think it's an important issue and one that we may have to face ourselves someday. He also writes [about how close we all are to being unhoused](https://www.welcometohellworld.com/they-are-you-after-a-couple-of-bad-breaks/) and that parents are [going in to debt over school lunch](https://www.welcometohellworld.com/school-lunch-debt-is/).


## Today in Tabs

by Rusty Foster, [todayintabs.com](https://www.todayintabs.com)
> Every civilized weekday (i.e. Mon-Thu, Fridays by appointment only) Today in Tabs contains a lot of internet, compressed as tightly as I can get it.

I don't spend a lot of time following the day's stories as they happen. It's nice to have them recapped in around 1000 words at a time.


## Citation Needed

by Molly White, [citationneeded.news](https://citationneeded.news/)
> Keep up with the happenings in the tech world without all the boosterism.

You may know Molly White from [Web3 is Going Just Great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com). I don't have an interest in cryptocurrency, but I do love watching venture capitalists suffer.


## Garbage Day

by Ryan Broderick, [garbageday.email](https://www.garbageday.email/)
> A newsletter about having fun online

I genuinely look forward to Garbage Day. It's a fun read through the week's internet drama without having to sift through all the discourse.
