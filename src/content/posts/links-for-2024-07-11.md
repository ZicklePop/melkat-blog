What are you reading? Hopefully you're reading some things that are a little more uplifting than what I have been, but if you look closely at this list you'll find a fun music video from The Aquabats and a free video game. That's something! And hey, I got you covered if you like seeing small acts of rebellion against big tech. See, there is some good in the world.

- [Why I don't need to clean up my desktop and downloads folder in macOS - Stefan Judis](https://www.stefanjudis.com/blog/why-i-dont-need-to-clean-up-my-desktop-and-downloads-folder-in-macos/)   
   I wish I was this amounts of brave, because I really like this idea.
- [My Glorious Ascension To Thought Leadership — Ludicity](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/my-glorious-ascension-to-thought-leadership/)   
   “Disclaimer: This advice may not apply in the U.S, where I have heard that in many states you can be fired for so much as thinking that the boss has made a mistake at any point in their lives.”
- [Meet the Queen of the Rideshare Mafia — Lauren Smiley](https://www.wired.com/story/priscila-queen-of-the-rideshare-mafia/)   
   The story of someone who made the gig economy work as advertised. Funny how corporations hate it when people become the success story that they made up.
- [Getting Caught Working Undercover at Amazon — Oobah’s Great Amazon Heist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVY4qTQnloU)   
   Speaking of corporations getting mad at people for doing what only they are allowed to get away with.
- [AI and Asbestos: the offset and trade-off models for large-scale risks are inherently harmful — Baldur Bjarnason](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/ai-asbestos/)   
   This is just an excellent comparison.
- [Nothing but punishment — Welcome to Hell World](https://www.welcometohellworld.com/nothing-but-punishment/)   
   “I was gonna say welp at least we had a pretty good run but we didn't did we? It wasn't all that good at all. At least we had a run though. At least we had that.”  
- [On Burnout, Mental Health, And Not Being Okay — Ludicity](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-burnout-mental-health-and-not-being-okay/)   
   Fuck it, I'll say it: I needed to read this.
- [Clara's Cauldron Conundrum – itch.io](https://ryankoning.itch.io/claras-cauldron-conundrum)   
   My [wife](https://peoplemaking.games/@TheEnbyWitch) worked on this with a group of people from the Portland Indie Game Squad!
- [Let’s Go Live In A Cave! Music Video - The Aquabats!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGf5k1gv7H4)   
   Hashtag cavelife. I love The Aquabats!  
- [Why I attack — Nicholas Carlini](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2024/why-i-attack.html)   
   Of course Glaze/Nightshade isn't actually effective at AI art poisoning. This was never going to be as easy as applying a slow and ugly Instagram filter!
- [Why Vivaldi browser won’t follow the current AI trend? — Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/vivaldi-wont-allow-a-machine-to-lie-to-you/)   
   Vivaldi was right about cryptocurrency and they are right about AI. I wish Mozilla held these same ethics but instead they're investing in AI and in becoming an advertising company. We need more options like Vivaldi.

Hey did you notice that my blog has a little reply link at the bottom of a post? I've made it easy for you to send me some nice words. I also made the post feed traversable with the `j` and `k` keys. That's a secret little feature for those of you who read to the end.
