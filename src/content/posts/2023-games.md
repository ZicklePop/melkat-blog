When I write these year-end reviews, I go back and try to figure out where my time went and then figure out if I should admit to playing so much Picross. I couldn't find anything I enjoyed as much as these three games this year.


## Like a Dragon: Ishin!

Years ago, Miyamoto said in an interview that Mario and friends are really just a [troupe of actors](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/9/25/3407672/miyamoto-the-mario-cast-is-a-troupe-of-actors-and-bowsers-kids-are), and in Ishin, that is exactly what Ryu Ga Gotoku has done with the classic characters of the Like a Dragon series. Kiryu and friends have been transported back to Japan's Bakumatsu era in the 1860s, playing mostly real people from that time. It has a lot in common with David Milch's _Deadwood_, which is also set in the late 1800s, with actors playing fictionalized versions of real people. So if _Japanese Deadwood_ sounds fun, you might want to give Ishin a try.


## Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name

While Ishin is a remaster and international release of a 2014 Japan-only game, Ryu Ga Gotoku also released a new game that connects the events of _Yakuza 6_ to _Like a Dragon_ from Kazuma Kiryu's perspective. While Gaiden is a shorter game, it provides the same enjoyment you would get from any Ryu Ga Gotoku game. That is more than enough for me.


## Suika Game

I remember where I was when I first heard about this game: high above the Pacific Ocean. I had a long flight ahead of me and I was already _doomscrolling_ the news when a headline about a viral new watermelon game in Japan. I did not read the article, but went straight to Nintendo Japan's eShop and spent the last 240 yen I had in my account. It was 12 hours later when I finally got to my hotel room with my Switch and a lot of jet lag, that I was able to play. I usually play an arcade game once before I'm kind of over it, but I played this game every day of my vacation. Then Super Mario Wonder came out, but that couldn't stop me. I have fruit that needs to be match.
