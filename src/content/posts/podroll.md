There was a time when I listened to a wide variety of podcasts. I even subscribed to video podcasts! Are those even still a thing anymore? I've been subscribed to podcasts since Apple introduced them to iTunes in 2005 which is over half a lifetime ago for me. Anyway, those days are long gone. I heard a lot of people cut back on podcasts when the pandemic first hit, but for me, podcasts weren't just a commute thing. Though, ever since the Jambox and now the HomePod, I find myself listening to them primarily when I am doing my morning and evening routines in the bathroom.

One reason I stopped listening to so many podcasts was that I got tired of listening to technology podcasts. I want to take a break from work when I'm not working. I don't care about your stocks, and I know all of the bad things going on in tech. I see it constantly.

The other reason my podcast listening declined is that I listened to a lot of comedy podcasts. After November 2016, their centrist politics became unbearable. After I came out as trans, I quickly grew tired of cisgender heterosexual white men making jokes about pronouns and gender identity. They had to go.

This leaves me with the last two podcasts in my feed.

I have been listening to [Stop Podcasting Yourself](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/stop-podcasting-yourself) since 2010 and I love Dave and Graham's sense of humor a lot. I've picked up a lot of Canadianisms from them and this great [Blink-182 sounding ad for a hotdog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMoBwQmfoB0). Pretty good.

I haven't been listening to [The Flop House](https://www.flophousepodcast.com) nearly as long. I think I started listening to them in late 2014 or early 2015. They watch a bad movie then they talk about it, among other things they call "Minis." 

And so there you have it: the two remaining podcasts that keep me coming back for more. Will I subscribe to another podcast? Probably. Hopefully! I don't know!
