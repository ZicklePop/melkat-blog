Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech), I have written up my current setup. I will try to keep this post updated as things change.


## Hardware

### The Bedrock

- [Blue Steelcase Gesture Office Chair](https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/gesture/)
- [Everlasting Comfort Office Foot Rest](https://amazon.com/Foot-Rest-Under-Desk-Footstool/dp/B07PGLBCFG)
- [Office Owl Caster Wheels for Desk Chairs](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B08JPXXK4C/)
- [UPLIFT Clamp-On Cup Holder](https://www.upliftdesk.com/clamp-on-cup-holder-by-uplift-desk/)
- [UPLIFT Bamboo Standing Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-bamboo-standing-desk/)
- [UPLIFT Big Standard Keyboard Tray - Bamboo with Quick Adjust Mechanism](https://www.upliftdesk.com/big-standard-keyboard-bamboo-tray-system-by-uplift-desk/)


### Computers

- iPad Pro - My main machine, I use it for everything
- Mac Studio - I use this for coding and building apps
- Custom PC - My gaming machine


### The Input Club

- [Keychron Q8](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q8-alice-layout-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard?variant=40077526859865) - A blue Alice layout with a knob with Gateron G Pro Red switches.
- [Keychron M6 Wireless Mouse](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-m6-wireless-mouse) - Basic? Yes. Works? Also yes.


### The Audio Video Club

- [Alienware 34" 120Hz Ultrawide Monitor - AW3420DW](https://amazon.com/Alienware-Curved-NVIDIA-Edgelight-Monitor/dp/B07YLGH9Q5) - Not a fan of Alienware, but I fell in love with the ultrawide form factor and wanted something that could handle high framerates.
- [Audio-Technica AT2020 XLR Microphone](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H92QK/)
- [Behringer UMC204HD Audio Interface](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0BK0)
- [FiiO BTR5 Bluetooth and USB-C DAC](https://www.fiio.com/btr5) - No headphone jack on the iOS devices anymore, so lets add it back through Bluetooth.
- [Hatsune Miku Edition TASCAM VL-S3BT Speakers](https://tascam.com/us/product/vl-s3/)
- [Opal C1](https://opalcamera.com) - This camera is pretty slick and in early beta. I hope to one day use it with Windows as well as Mac. As of this writing it runs 105Â°F when it's not in use, the software is lacking.
- [RAZER Kiyo Camera w/ Ring Light](https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo) - Not a fan of Razer, but it solved a lighting issue for me. Where I cannot use the Opal C1, I will use this camera.
- [Samson SR850 Headphones](https://amazon.com/Samson-SR850-Semi-Open-Back-Reference-Headphones/dp/B002LBSEQS) with [Brainwavz Cooling Gel Earpads](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B07SBT93R9/) - Long cable, amazing sound, and with the replacement earpads they are the most comfortable headphones I own. Great for all day wear. Recommended by [DankPods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk-Tybi-ihw 'YouTube Video: The DankPods Headphone Starter Guide.')!


## Software

### Multiplatform

- [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Use a password manager. Use unique passwords. Use two-factor auth. Just do it, already.
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) - A full Illustrator experience on all of my devices, even iPad. No subscription fees.
- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - A full Photoshop experience on all of my devices, even iPad. No subscription fees.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - I need my notes to be everywhere, and a lot of note taking apps are either AI garbage or Apple-only and that's no good.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A fast and reliable code editor that is extendible. Runs on any platform either natively or in the web browser.


### iOS

- [Inspect Browser](https://apps.pdyn.net/inspect/) - Inspect Element for iOS, not as full featured but the best and most reliable I've found.
- [Prompt 3](https://panic.com/prompt/) - A shell with SSH, Mosh, and Eternal Terminal support
- [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) - Old reliable code editor. It's no VS Code, but it's pretty good for prototyping HTML or JavaScript.
- [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) - Git on iOS and it works with other apps.


### macOS

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Quickly perform tasks, find apps and files, and manage your clipboard history.
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) - Please don't throw images up online without making sure their file size is as small as it can be without reducing image quality.
- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) - A terminal that I can split the views in half vertically or horizontally. I swear I don't use most of what this offers.
- [Nova](https://nova.app) - A pretty good editor that handles projects quite nicely.
