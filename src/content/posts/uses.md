Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech), I have written up my current setup. I will try to keep this post updated as things change.


## Hardware

### The Bedrock

- [Bamboo Motion-X Board by UPLIFT Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/bamboo-motion-x-board-by-uplift-desk/)
- [Blue Steelcase Gesture Office Chair](https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/gesture/)
- [Everlasting Comfort Office Foot Rest](https://smile.amazon.com/Foot-Rest-Under-Desk-Footstool/dp/B07PGLBCFG)
- [Office Owl Caster Wheels for Desk Chairs](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JPXXK4C/)
- [UPLIFT Clamp-On Cup Holder](https://www.upliftdesk.com/clamp-on-cup-holder-by-uplift-desk/)
- [UPLIFT Bamboo Standing Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-bamboo-standing-desk/) 
- [UPLIFT Big Standard Keyboard Tray - Bamboo with Quick Adjust Mechanism](https://www.upliftdesk.com/big-standard-keyboard-bamboo-tray-system-by-uplift-desk/)


### Computers

- iPad Pro - My main machine, I use it for everything
- Mac Studio - I use this for coding and building apps
- Custom PC - My gaming machine


### The Input Club

- [Keychron Q8](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q8-alice-layout-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard?variant=40077526859865) - A blue Alice layout with a knob with Gateron G Pro Red switches.
- [Kensington SlimBlade Trackball](https://www.kensington.com/p/products/ergonomic-desk-accessories/ergonomic-input-devices/slimblade-trackball/) - I learned during quarantine that my hand starts to hurt after long periods of using a regular mouse. I've now gone full trackball.
- [Kone XP](https://www.roccat.com/products/kone-xp) - I wanted to try out a gaming mouse and this seemed like the perfect place to start. It's light and has automatic profile switching between apps and games.


### The Audio Video Club

- [Alienware 34" 120Hz Ultrawide Monitor - AW3420DW](https://smile.amazon.com/Alienware-Curved-NVIDIA-Edgelight-Monitor/dp/B07YLGH9Q5) - Not a fan of Alienware, but I fell in love with the ultrawide form factor and wanted something that could handle high framerates.
- [Audio-Technica AT2020 XLR Microphone](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H92QK/)
- [Behringer UMC204HD Audio Interface](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0BK0)
- [FiiO BTR5 Bluetooth and USB-C DAC](https://www.fiio.com/btr5) - No headphone jack on the iOS devices anymore, so lets add it back through Bluetooth.
- [Hatsune Miku Edition TASCAM VL-S3BT Speakers](https://tascam.com/us/product/vl-s3/)
- [Opal C1](https://opalcamera.com) - This camera is pretty slick and in early beta. I hope to one day use it with Windows as well as Mac. As of this writing it runs 105Â°F when it's not in use, the software is lacking, and it only works in Zoom and Chrome.
- [RAZER Kiyo Camera w/ Ring Light](https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo) - Not a fan of Razer, but it solved a lighting issue for me. Where I cannot use the Opal C1, I will use this camera.
- [Samson SR850 Headphones](https://smile.amazon.com/Samson-SR850-Semi-Open-Back-Reference-Headphones/dp/B002LBSEQS) with [Brainwavz Cooling Gel Earpads](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SBT93R9/) - Long cable, amazing sound, and with the replacement earpads they are the most comfortable headphones I own. Great for all day wear. Recommended by [DankPods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk-Tybi-ihw 'YouTube Video: The DankPods Headphone Starter Guide.')!


## Software

### Multiplatform

- [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Use a password manager. Use unique passwords. Use two-factor auth. Just do it, already.
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) - A full Illustrator experience on all of my devices, even iPad. No subscription fees.
- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - A full Photoshop experience on all of my devices, even iPad. No subscription fees.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A fast and reliable code editor that is extendible. Runs on any platform either natively or in the web browser.


### iOS

- [Blink Shell](https://blink.sh/) - SSH and Mosh support, now with the ability to mount SSH connections to the Files app, and the ability to launch VS Code.
- [Inspect Browser](https://apps.pdyn.net/inspect/) - Inspect Element for iOS, not as full featured but the best and most reliable I've found.
- [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) - Old reliable code editor. It's no VS Code, but it's pretty good for prototyping HTML or JavaScript.
- [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) - Git on iOS and it works with other apps.


### Windows 11

- [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) - There are so many features in here I love but I use FancyZones the most to move windows around in predetermined positions on my screen.
- [Velocity](https://velocity.silverlakesoftware.com/) - This is like Dash for Mac but on Windows. It stores a variety of documentation for programming offline where you can easily search it for what you're looking for.


### macOS

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Quickly perform tasks, find apps and files, and manage your clipboard history.
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) - Everyone wants to be in the macOS menu bar. Hide those distractions.
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) - Stores coding documentation offline where you can search it for what you're looking for.
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) - Please don't throw images up online without making sure their file size is as small as it can be without reducing image quality.
- [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) - What company spyware is causing my Mac to be so slow? Oh it's probably just Docker. I hate it when Docker eats all available resources when it's idle.
- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) - A terminal that I can split the views in half vertically or horizontally. I swear I don't use most of what this offers.


## Customizations

* Color scheme: [Dracula Pro](https://draculatheme.com/pro)
* Font: [Cartograph](https://connary.com/cartograph.html)
* [My dotfiles are available on Github](https://github.com/zicklepop/dotfiles)


## VS Code Extensions

- [change-case](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case) - There is nothing like a handy way to convert which case your text or variables are. 
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - Never spend another hour trying to debug code that would work if didn't make that typo.

- [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) - I use this for connecting to a Windows Subsystem for Linux quite often, but it's also great for working over SSH.
- [Sort lines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.sort-lines) - Like casing, there's nothing like a quick way to remove duplicates from a list and sort it at the same time.
- [Turbo Console Log](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log) - Highlight text and press a keyboard shortcut to have your own easy to find console log. Each log is easily identifiable with an emoji, file name, and line number.


## Browser Extensions

### Multiplatform

- [Noir](https://getnoir.app/) - My preferred extension for applying dark mode to websites that haven't implemented their own dark modes yet.
- [Vinegar](https://andadinosaur.com/launch-vinegar) - Replaces YouTube video players with one that supports picture-in-picture and stops that annoying auto-play. (use with Baking Soda to make all video players play nice)
