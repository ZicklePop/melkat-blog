Social media companies want you to post more but only want to show ads. What's the point of posting if no one sees it? To train their AIs and target you with more ads? People often told me they wish I used one of the big evil tech company's social media apps more often so they could keep up with me or my cat. My cat has a lot going on. She's _BUSY_!

These requests made me feel like I had to maintain a social media presence. Those big social media companies might have started by calling them "a place for friends," but unless your friends are brands, no, they aren't. I'm not a brand. I'm a person. If you want to keep up with me, you must look outside the ads.

I like the sentiment behind "I miss your posts," but it says, "I don't care enough to look at a different website." Here's the thing: I didn't go offline. I went elsewhere. It's the _world wide web_â€”not the four hell sites of the apocalypse. It's never been easier to keep up with me on my website. You might wind up wanting to use an app without ads, but isn't that a blessing?

"But Melanie, it's too hard!" Isn't everything the first time? What would we do if we stopped doing things because they're hard? I can't count the number of times people said microblogging sites like Twitter would never catch on because they were too obtuse. Now, people are clinging to its corpse like it will somehow save them. That complacency is how we got to this nightmare stage of capitalism. I don't have to be on Facebook. I'm sorry, I don't.

I'll continue to work on making myself more accessible, but I will do it safely and humanely, or I will not do it at all.
