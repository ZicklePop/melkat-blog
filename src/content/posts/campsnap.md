Photographer [Jedda convinced me](https://jeddacp.me/campsnap103/) to try the screen-free Camp Snap Camera. It looks like a film camera I bought a while back, but without all the hassle of getting film and developing it. I really like it! When I finish taking photos I can simply plug it in to my phone and copy the photos over. I've been sharing my photos on my [Pixelfed](https://nyan.pics/@zicklepop) and you check out my collection of [photos taken with my Camp Snap](https://nyan.pics/c/743699623752752275). I just learned you can [install different filters](https://www.campsnapphoto.com/pages/support-v103), so I'm going to be insufferable with black and white photos for a while.
