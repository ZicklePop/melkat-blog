When I was 13 years old, I waited over a week for my Red Hat Linux ISO file to download. I saw these nerds on TechTV talk about it, and I wanted to try it myself. I told my parents what I was doing, and they told me that my older half-brother had mentioned it. I installed it that night and quickly realized that my speakers didn't work, and I had accidentally installed it over my Windows XP installation. That was not my intention, lol. I spent the weekend reinstalling Windows and Red Hat.

I had spent years theming my Windows XP to look like Linux. I loved [Everaldo Coelho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everaldo_Coelho)'s Crystal icon set. These icons were made for Linux, so I wanted to go where his art could surround me. I quickly learned I needed KDE instead of Red Hat's default Gnome. Thankfully, my brother would gift me a boxed copy of [SuSE Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSUSE). I was the happiest 13-year-old that holiday.

By the time I was 14, I had convinced my dad to let me install Linux on his work computer. I snuck "live CDs" of Linux into my mom's machine. Live CDs boot Linux off of a single CD and do not install on a hard drive, so when my mom got mad and demanded I fix her computer, I would simply eject the CD.

_Content warning: Homophobia_
(skip five paragraphs)

I had a laptop and a Wi-Fi ExpressCard but could never get it to work. I spent months trying, but I could only use it with Windows. I had to buy a _paid_ Linux driver to finally get it to work. I know that's against the laws of the free-libre open-source software world, but it was 2004, and Wi-Fi was magic. Just as long as Dad wasn't using the microwave to pop some popcorn. I said it was magic; I didn't say it wasn't delicate.

So, finally, success! I had Wi-Fi! I had a friend over at the time. He was a Mac guy and had one of those cool, colorful clamshell iBooks. I hugged him out of excitement. Everything was fine. My parents got a call that evening after he had left. The next thing I knew, I was being called into our living room, where my mom, my friend, and his mom were sitting.

That hug between two young teenagers was, apparently, gay. Their goal was to force me to come out in front of my mom. I don't believe my mom had any idea what they wanted to have this group sit down for, but in hindsight, the thing she should have done was tell them to get the fuck out of our house and never talk to us again.

Instead, I just sat there scared. I wasn't attracted to men, and I wouldn't say I was. I never thought there was anything wrong with being gay, which in the early 2000s was an opinion that screamed to homophobes that you were super gay. Ultimately, nothing happened. I lost a friend. I developed some trauma. I was about to start high school, and this served as a foreshadowing of how that would go.

I survived one semester of my first year of high school before having to leave for my safety due to assumptions that I was gay. Everyone was so sure I was attracted to men. Little did they know: I wasn't gay, just a lesbian.

I remember downloading Gentoo Linux. The download wasn't too long, but I had to wait over a week for it to finish compiling and installing everything. It was fine, but I eventually swapped it to Slackware. I liked it a lot, but since this in 2004 I was also wanting to play a lot of World of Warcraft which I couldn't really do well on Linux.

In 2005, since I couldn't continue attending public high school, I worked hard to save up money to get the first-generation Mac Mini. It was amazing, tiny, and kind of disappointing at first. My experience with Windows and Linux was that when you install an operating system, you have to spend about a week setting everything up to work appropriately. With the Mac, I didn't have to do that. That was great, but also boring, you know?

I've stayed with Apple computers ever since, but I switched to Windows off and on after 2016, when the Mac stopped being as fun as it was in the mid-2000s. All those Linux skills I built up worked well with OS X and at work, where I needed to SSH into Linux machines.

My wife decided to try Arch Linux last weekend. It looked neat, so I cleaned off a hard drive on my gaming machine and installed it myself. I saw what KDE had been up to on my Steam Deck, which looked impressive. I'm so tired of Windows and Mac. Microsoft and Apple are both focused on destroying the environment and forcing AI bullshit on us. It's gotten so bad that I feel like Linux is the only way I can continue using a computer for computing.

So far, it has gone well. I'm writing this from Arch Linux now! I wonder how long before I feel the urge to swap back to Windows or Mac. I'm so happy Linux has improved so much in the last twenty yearsâ€”lol, well, except for setting up a printer.

No one can solve for printers.
