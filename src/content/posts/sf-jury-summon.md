In San Francisco, when we get summoned for jury duty, we are lucky enough to have a [website to check](https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/jury-services/jury-reporting) that tells us it will be updated at 4:30 pm on weekdays. It's a pretty simple website, which makes it perfect for automating this task.


## Ask Siri

You can use the Shortcuts.app on your Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, and Mac. You will need to add your group number to the script for this to work.

## Home screen widget

There is a great app for iPhone and iPad called [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) that lets you write and run JavaScript that can make home screen widgets. You will need to set your group number on line with `const GROUP\_NUMBER`.
