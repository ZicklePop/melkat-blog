In the wake of the death of social media, it seems that some of the best app developers have decided to make RSS reader "super apps." A "super app" is a fancy marketing term for a single app that does pretty much everything. A lot of financial technology companies want to be "super apps" so they can own every part of your money. In the land of RSS feeds, the goal is to merge all of your apps that are just glorified RSS feeds, like podcasts, news, and social media, into one.

I'm in private TestFlight betas of two apps that want to accomplish this. I won't get too specific about them because, well, they are betas. I'm going to speak broadly and about common approaches to this that I've seen.

So far, the apps I've played with have this wild idea that they don't need to connect to a centralized service for RSS feeds. For example, I have around 200 RSS feeds in [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com). What these "super apps" are asking is for me to put all of those feeds into one app. None of them have import features at this moment, so I have to do it one by one. Fine, they are betas, no big deal. I'm great at repetitive, meaningless tasks. [You should hire me](https://melaniekat.com).

With Feedbin, I can use their service to check all of these feeds frequently on their own servers, but with these apps I have to wait for their app to use my cellular data to hit over 200 websites and then make even more requests to get things like images. This is a huge issue for three key reasons: this process is slow, this process uses a fair amount of data, and since the requests are coming from my phone, the feeds can potentially figure out information about me.

You may think it's unfair of me to put around 200 feeds in a beta feed reader, but I disagree. The point of these apps is to let you to connect to as many sources as possible. If you want to replace many apps, your app is going to have to do the heavy lifting of figuring out the best way to handle this. By not having integrations with feed reader services, you are accepting this responsibility. I don't think it's a good idea to ask my phone to do all the heavy lifting. I do know these apps are very slow because I have to wait for it to check hundreds of feeds.

There's also a redundant task being asked of me here: to track YouTube channels, everyone does that with an RSS feed, and I can choose to do it through manually categorizing it as a YouTube channel or as a generic RSS feed. The same for podcast: do I add the feed as a podcast or a RSS feed? Instead of essentially having me categorize this from the start manually, why not determine how to display the content based on the feed items? I get that some of this is to make it more visually intuitive for people who might not be into RSS, but it still feels more like I'm tagging individual feeds that could be inferred without my help.

Despite my criticisms, I do like what these RSS reading "super apps" are going for. I also worry that apps in general are moving away from doing one thing well to doing everything and none of it very well. I hope that these apps will consider letting a server do the heavy lifting.
