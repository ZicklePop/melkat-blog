My [wife](https://vivi.the.enbywit.ch) just finished a PIGS Summer Slow Jam, a game jam, where the theme was resource management, with four others called [Clara's Cauldron Conumdrum](https://ryankoning.itch.io/claras-cauldron-conundrum) that I think you should play, but I am biased. I also recommend checking out [the other games submitted](https://itch.io/jam/ssjresourcemanagement/entries), they're pretty great too!
