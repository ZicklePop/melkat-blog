> Put a pride flag frame on an image for your profile pictures

This is the web version of an [Apple Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2664/) I made in 2018, which pushed the limits of what you can do with the platform and dynamic image generation using the built-in toolset. The performance of the shortcut got worse over time, and it stopped working in 2022.

This was something I had wanted to build for a while, and I limited myself to doing it entirely in the browser for privacy reasons. You can also access the full [source code on GitHub.](https://github.com/ZicklePop/pride-frames)
