For this roundup of links I've got bad social media websites, big tech's big failures, and a fun music video and a RSS tool that I enjoy. Stay safe out there and go host your own website!

- [Unsafe: Meta Fails to Moderate Extreme Anti-trans Hate Across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads](https://glaad.org/smsi/report-meta-fails-to-moderate-extreme-anti-trans-hate-across-facebook-instagram-and-threads/)   
   I've seen what GLAAD calls "acceptable" so when they say something is bad it must be REALLY REALLY bad!
- [Porter Robinson - Cheerleader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzJbz9qSsd0)   
   Porter Robinson’s new music video for the song “Cheerleader” is really good  
- [The PS5 Crashes Way More Than Any Console I’ve Ever Owned](https://www.thegamer.com/ps5-crash-way-more-any-console-ever-owned/)   
   So it isn't just me, the PS5 is just that broken  
- [CEO of Data Privacy Company Onerep.com Founded Dozens of People-Search Firms – Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/ceo-of-data-privacy-company-onerep-com-founded-dozens-of-people-search-firms/)   
   Mozilla's comment is not! good! (but they did cut ties afterwards)  
- [A Real Social Security Office Gave Me a Flyer With a Scam Phone Number On It](https://theintercept.com/2024/03/17/social-security-scam-nyc/)   
   Not to spoil the end of this article, but I love that the SSA office basically says the quote from the hot dog guy meme from I Think You Should Leave.  
- [Cohost's Financials - A Retrospective](https://d-shoot.net/cohostfinance.html)   
   No one should be using Cohost for a variety of reasons. Here are a few: child endangerment, preying on poor queer kids for money, and many security vulnerabilities   
- [ServerlessHorrors](https://serverlesshorrors.com/)   
   A collection of stories from people receiving thousands of dollars worth of bills from using services like Netlify, Vercel, Mailgun, and Google Cloud  
- [Viticci: I was wondering why Shortcuts kept silently swapping the action from one app with another action from another app.  Turns out, two actions from two different apps (and different developers) confuse Shortcuts if...they have the same name](https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112093855225700828)   
   I'm getting big “”security is my passion”” energy from Apple 
- [Figuring out how to get people to pay you for the thing you make is hard.](https://petebrown.gibber.blog/figuring-out-how-to-get-people-to-pay-you-for-the-thing-you-make-it-hard)   
   This take on ad supported media is pretty good  
- [Google’s self-designed office swallows Wi-Fi “like the Bermuda Triangle”](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-self-designed-office-swallows-wi-fi-like-the-bermuda-triangle/)   
   Another banger product launch from Google  
- [Big find for pro metal detector: hundreds of smart watches](https://www.shawlocal.com/northwest-herald/2024/03/03/big-find-for-pro-metal-detector-hundreds-of-smart-watches/)   
   Apple’s watches are polluting the waters. “The ones with the sports bands ... they do not stay on in the water”  
- [American Gadgets](https://flaminghydra.com/american-gadgets/)   
   On the Apple Vision Pro and assault rifles (paywalled)  
- [WFH WTF - Breakfast Letters](https://www.breakfastletters.com/wfh-wtf)   
   Never return to the office.  
- [RsS iS dEaD LOL](https://rss-is-dead.lol/)   
   This is a really cool tool for finding RSS feeds from the people you follow online's websites
