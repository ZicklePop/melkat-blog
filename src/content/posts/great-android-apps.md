I was recently thinking about what got me interested in apps and design were the many websites that featured beautiful apps. Typically, these websites were focused on apps for Apple products, but as we see Apple go down this anti-developer and anti-consumer path of a monopoly, I think it's time we focus on the great apps for the other devices in our life, so today I'm going to share some apps for Android I was not aware of until recently.


## Android Originals

### [AntennaPod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod)

It's a podcast app in my favorite style: minimal. Every podcast app wants to be a metaverse of nonsense and I respect those that don't.


### [Capy Reader for Feedbin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.capyreader.app)

I've spent years looking for a good Feedbin app for Android and I think I found it. The lack of swipe gestures to mark feed items as read or starred is frustrating to my decades of muscle memory, but honestly this app is almost exactly what an RSS reader should be.


### [Client for Put.io](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=putio.client.android)

The "now draw the rest of the owl" of Put.io apps, it lets you actually manage torrents and downloads, something that Apple doesn't allow.


### [K-9 Mail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9)

I suspect this app is in the process of being rebranded as Thunderbird for Android. It's easier to set up than Thunderbird on computers.


### [Pano Scrobbler for LastFM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arn.scrobble)

While music scrobblers for Last.fm exist on iOS, they are very finicky through no fault of their own, so get this: an app that works with any music app you allow it to. Is that basic? Yes. Is it infinitely more powerful than is possible on iOS? Also yes.


### [Tusky for Mastodon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky)

I was looking forward to playing with this Mastodon client more than I actually am enjoying it. I guess I just want the ability to pin custom lists to the tab bar. But hey, cute icon.


## Wait, that iOS App is on Android???

If you are finding your Apple-centric apps stagnating, why not try making them available everywhere?

### [App in the Air](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aita)

I've lived through several generations of flight tracking apps and this one is a former best of class. The UI has always been a little too cute for its own good, but I think the real thing that pushed me away was the pivot to trying to be travel agent with affiliate partnerships. But hey, it respects my lifetime subscription and still syncs with TripIt, so it gets the job done.


### [iA Writer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ia.iawriter.x)

iA Writer is neat, but I moved away from it because it wanted to rely on Apple's Files app and the constantly changing APIs. I couldn't store my files where I wanted to on iOS. I don't even know how it would handle files and stuff on Android and I haven't taken the time since I primarily use other apps now.

Also, I don't know what to make of their [AI-related updates](https://ia.net/writer/support/editor/authorship). It feels like they wanted to find a middle ground between Yes AI and No AI and ugh I'm not interested in trying to figure out what I really think of all that when I can just, you know, not think of it. Why have a little AI, as a treat, when I can have no AI?


### [Network Analyzer Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.techet.netanalyzer.an)

Sometimes I just want to run some basic network testing commands and this app did it pretty well on iOS. I haven't purchased it for Android but it looks just like the iOS app so I assume it will be useful when I need it.


## Launchers

If you aren't aware of Android launchers, these are essentially alternative home screens. On iOS they call it "Spring Board" but on Android you can replace it with whatever you want.


### [Niagra Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher)

Part of making Android work for me was replacing the silly UI all Android devices come with for getting around the OS. Honestly, if I could use this on iOS I probably would. This launcher works great on tiny screens, e-ink screens, and big screens alike.


### [FLauncher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.efesser.flauncher)

The biggest problem with Android is the amount of bloatware that Google themselves force on you. I don't like Google, I don't use Google, I don't want Google. FLauncher is great for Android TVs because you can easily just hide all that nonsense and focus on the things you want to use. I don't know what a good TV launcher looks like, but at least this one is chill.


## Installers

### [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org)

A privacy-focused alternative store for free apps. It lets you filter out apps by what they call "anti-features" like privacy risks.


### [Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev)

Download apps directly from the devs, no waiting for the Google Play approval process. It's pretty smart, but the UI can be pretty hard to tell if you are selecting multiple of items from the list or not, and well, whoops I ended up uninstalling everything but the app I wanted to uninstall.


## Apps You Won't Find on Google Play Store

### [Breezy Weather](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather)

A full featured privacy respecting free weather app.


### [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader)

The most advanced reading app I have ever seen, for better or worse. This app might look overwhelming, but it will do anything. Great for e-ink devices.

## That's all for now

Do you have any apps I should know about? I'd like to do this for Linux and Windows too, so if you're interested or have suggestions for apps on those platforms I would love to hear from you!
