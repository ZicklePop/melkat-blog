I have some thoughts on your average community discord. I'm not talking about any specific communities here, but of the idea as a whole. Seriously, I am NOT talking about you.

I've been on Discord. I've seen hell. Everyone thinks they have to have a discord server these days. Sometimes it works out, sometimes blows up like a tesla. OH NO! You don't have enough buckets of sand to put out a fire like that.

Shoutout to a certain indie web streaming service for realizing that they probably don't need an official discord community, and shutting down theirs. I don't know what their reasoning was, but it strikes me as a very brand-safe thing to do. Community moderation is _messy_. Mistakes _will_ be made. We don't know where everyone we talk to is in their lives. I hope you're having a lovely day!

Which brings me to my first point: do you really need one? Remember, this will expose you directly to _internet randos_, you know, like me. Do you _really_ want to deal with them? They are _randos_!

Okay so you survived the "what, why?" and you still want to make a discord server, you might be tempted to create some channels. This is where I see the second biggest mistake: off-topic channels. These aren't always bad, but my educated guess is that nothing good will come out of a `#vent` or `#politics` channel. Are you brave enough to read a channel called `#off-topic` or `#random`? I'm over here like Homer Simpson in a lesbian bar: looking for the fire exits.

And finally, the final nail in the coffin: people who think they can be their own mod. Are you a ""CEO""? Get out of here! Never do your own moderation. When people criticize the "brand," it's going to hit you in the ego. You will take it personally and give people like me the urge to screen capture your bad take that you wrote, stream of consciousness, and roast your ass on Mastodon. I have _dozens_ of followers!

At this point, I have to assume that you have made all three of these massive mistakes. I'm sorry, there's no more help for you. I gave you the best advice you could ask for, straight from the heart. Meanwhile, I logged off hours ago.
