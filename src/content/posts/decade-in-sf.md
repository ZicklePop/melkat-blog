I moved to San Francisco only months after graduating from a small university in a small town in a small state. I was 22 years old. I didn’t have anything lined up and I had about three months to find a job.

What I found was a startup run by a guy who spent all day yelling at people on the phone when he wasn’t playing emotional manipulation games with his employees. It didn’t pay nearly enough to live in San Francisco but it bought me some time to find a better job.

I now had about a month or so to find another job and the one I chose seemed good, a startup with no benefits. They kept saying health insurance was coming. I worked there for over a year and got paid at least 50% of the time. The other employees and I realized why health insurance would never come: in order for a company to provide health insurance you have to _be a company_. Then, when it came time to do my taxes, I realized that I had been lied to again. I wasn’t even an employee, I was a contractor. This meant that I had to pay all of my taxes out of my own pocket, and I had no money set aside for that. The only money I had was going to rent and food. I wasn’t getting paid regularly, I wasn’t an employee, and I wasn’t even working for a real company. It was time to find another job, and fast.

I interviewed with a promising company that ghosted me. I didn’t know it, but they were in the process of being acquired by a big evil tech company. Months later I found out I got the job and they asked me if I wanted to join them at the big evil tech company. I knew the company was evil, they had just published an unethical research paper bragging about emotionally manipulating their users to make them angry so they would stay on their website longer. I deleted their email and laughed about it to my parents. My parents didn’t think it was funny and told me that I should go work for the big evil tech company. The next time I checked my email, there was another email from them asking me why I hadn't accepted their job offer yet. I guess they were used to people jumping at the chance to accept their offers.

My time at big evil tech company nearly destroyed me. On top of everything else, I began to feel overwhelming shame for working at a company that was actively causing harm all around the world. There were often protests going on outside the office.

When you have worked for a big evil tech company for a few years, anything else looks better and feels more relaxing. I was actually happy at my next job. I was healing. …And then I realized I am transgender, and the once happy and respected employee was now treated _differently_. This is a common experience for trans people: They are the model employee, but as soon as they come out, people start treating them like a lesser person. Oh, and you have to deal with all the stress of being a trans person in a world that wants you dead. _Welcome to the X-Men, I hope you survive the experience._

This sounds horrible, because it is, but the best thing that happened to me was the start of the pandemic in 2020. Don't get me wrong, the pandemic is horrible and ongoing, but I no longer had to survive a commute where alt-right podcast fans were asking me invasive questions. I no longer had to worry about presenting myself in a certain way. I could just exist. Oh, and play Animal Crossing. I met my wife pretty early on at the start of the pandemic. Everything sucked, but it became manageable with her.

When people transition they often start a new job where people don't know their deadname and they're less likely to be misgendered. I didn't know I was taking a page out of the trans playbook, but I can say that it's a pretty effective strategy. Since everyone was working from home, it was easier to interview for jobs without anyone noticing. It was also the first time I was able to casually look for a job; before, I was always on a tight deadline to find work and would take any interview I could get.

Last December (2023) my wife and I got married. It was pretty important to me that we did it in San Francisco, a city I have been in love with since I was young. All in all, it's been a good run, but now I want to try something new, and what a great note to end on.
