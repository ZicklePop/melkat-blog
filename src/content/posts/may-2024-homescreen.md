What's different:

- [Textastic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor/id1049254261) - A simple text editor that I can use to write HTML and see it previewed. I've used this app for over a decade now, geez!
- [Gibberish](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gibberish-writer/id6475566085) - And a Dinosaur keeps making these bite sized app with full sized usefulness. This one is a iMessage-for-Notes app with the ability to publish them to a [Gibber Blog](https://gibber.blog/). I used this to write [The Absurd World of Children's Smart Watches](https://melkat.blog/p/childrens-smart-watches)
- [Status.lol](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/status-log/id6444921793) - I love this app made by the [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/melanie) community for the omg.lol community.
- [Inspect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inspect-browser/id1203594958) - The best "inspect element" for mobile.
- [Darkroom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/darkroom-photo-video-editor/id953286746) - I also got this app a decade ago, wtf! I love that commitment. To be honest I never really used it, but I've been playing a lot withâ€¦
- [Obscura](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/obscura-pro-camera/id1579306989) - I've been trying to improve my photography game, shoot some raws, and oh yeah [take more photos](https://nyan.pics/@zicklepop). Obscura, as far as I can tell, doesn't want to be a photo editor, just a camera. I respect that! So when it's time to edit and tweak the photos Obscura just bounces me to Darkroom. Nice. Also has a sweet trans theme and icon.
- [Copilot Money](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-track-budget-money/id1447330651) - I need to get my finances in order and this app is fine. I know making a finance app is hard, but I wish we had more good decent choices with less crypto nonsense. Use my referral code [PCK8UP](https://copilot.money/link/xmK9yAsDUy4WNwmTA) and get some extra months to try it out.
- [Kino](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kino-pro-video-camera/id6472380172) - A new video recording app I've been wanting to try, so I put it on the home screen as a reminder.

Wallpapers are variant 4 of the new pride wallpaper on the iPhone and iPad.
