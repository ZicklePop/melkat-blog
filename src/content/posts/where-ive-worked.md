title: Where I've Worked
tags: [post, me, criticism]

I feel like if someone wanted to, they could probably figure out where I have worked. My last employer featured me on their blog and until recently I didn't know that I was featured a second time! As I try to figure out what I want to work on next, maybe it would be beneficial to, you know, mention that stuff.

## I don't want to be customer support

Companies hate providing support without some sort of friction. This friction will lead to customers finding anyone who will listen, which is totally fair. They also don't want to pay people to provide support. When I was apartment hunting I started getting text messages that behaved like they were being written by real people from some of these properties. In the middle of the night. They were obviously the extremely problematic and trendy chat bots. I expect this to lead to more customers trying to find any way possible to get a human to help them. Good. Exploit whatever it takes to get the help you need.

## I am not a target

Scammers love to target employees of a company in hopes of manipulating them either in to gaining information or access. Well, jokes on them I don't know anything and I hate having access to sensitive things.

Businesses also love to make decisions that are, to put it lightly, controversial. When this happens they don't really ask their employees because they know most of them would say "could we not?" This leads to customers saying "could you not?" Employees probably agree with the customer and have raised these concerns themselves butâ€¦

This isn't to say customers shouldn't complain and raise a stink. I appreciate the stink. We need more stink.

## I am my own person

I don't want people to think of me as belonging to a corporation or somehow connected. When people think of me, I want them to think of, well, me. I would rather someone think "oh there's blue hair and pronouns" than "hey it's that person who worked for some billion dollar company." One of those descriptors is about me, the other is free marketing for a corporation who isn't paying me to be a mascot. Unrelated, if you want to pay me to be your mascot here's [my Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/melkat).

So what is the point of all of this? I think maybe it's about how I know I might seem more attractive to potential employers if they looked at my website and saw something they might find impressive, "Ooo she worked for (company)!" I would rather just avoid the negatives that come with that and the dehumanization of myself, "Eww she worked for (company)!"

I would like to be your friend and not a "internet personality brand."

Oh and if you would like to hire me as an incredibly talented remote front-end engineer, [say hey](https://melaniekat.com/hey). I just moved to a relatively less expensive city so I guess that means you can pay me next to nothing to do the same work I've done for over a decade in the most expensive city America has to offer!
