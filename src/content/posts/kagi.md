I swapped to DuckDuckGo over a decade ago and never looked back. I find the results to be as good or a little better than _the others_. Kagi, while it does cost money, is even better. I am actually finding things with it I couldn't otherwise. You can try it for free and even set it up to work with [iOS and Mac](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1622835804).
