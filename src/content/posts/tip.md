If you find yourself with spare money, please consider giving it to [Trans Lifeline](https://translifeline.org) or someone directly who is using the hashtag TransCrowdFund. It is always a scary time for queer people all over the world and you have the power to make a big difference in someone's life.

**You absolutely do not have to hand it to me.** The 'it' being your hard earned money. But you can and I probably won't stop you. You can even set up recurring subscriptions to me for what I like to call Melanie+, for $1 a month, or if you're daring, Melanie++ for $2 a month.

By subscribing to Melanie+ or Melanie++ there are two key features you won't find from other "plus" subscription services: no ads and no subscription hikes. I will also promise you I won't use your money to produce bigoted standup specials. That's value!
