Read later apps started as a way to have a distraction-free reading experience. Today many of them want to be yet another feed of never ending content. They want you to be distracted while they shovel "content" at you.

Apps like Pocket and Matter want to make sure you are reading the latest hustle bro articles. They want you to follow their hand picked "creators" and not to worry about their troubling politics. I just have to trust them. Meanwhile apps like Readwise Reader, Instapaper, and Omnivore want you to read less. Just trust their AI to summarize those articles. I'm sure all those words the original author used weren't important.

The only useful feature I've seen added to read later apps in the last year or so has been natural-ish sounding text-to-speech features. They aren't perfect but they serve a purpose and help with accessibility, even if they read things like iPadOS at eye-pod-us.

But hey, at least Omnivore isn't (currently) asking for me to pay for the privilege. I don't mind paying if the app is good and respectful of my time, but I have yet to find one like that. Until then, I can only hope someone teaches these apps to just chill for a single second.
