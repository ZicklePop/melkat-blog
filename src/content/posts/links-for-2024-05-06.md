Last month I moved from San Francisco to Portland with my wife and cat. Moving is so stressful. Despite being overwhelmed with all of that, I've still be keeping an eye on the internet and reading all these interesting pieces!

- [Inclusive Design](https://heynova.io/blog/2023-10-designing-for-people-with-adhd/)   
   Hey Nova has a lot of tips to make design inclusive for people with ADHD. I worked on what people call “Growth” teams and the first rule of that is make people feel like they are “almost done” from the get go. It’s obviously manipulative but it’s also just flat out harmful.
- [Facebook’s AI Spam Isn’t the ‘Dead Internet’: It’s the Zombie Internet](https://www.404media.co/facebooks-ai-spam-isnt-the-dead-internet-its-the-zombie-internet/)   
   I wonder if this is the start of making it look like people use their failed Horizon "metaverse" app they rebranded the company around?  
- [We need more calm companies](https://justinjackson.ca/calm-company/)   
   I like this article but I disagree that layoffs are inevitable. You may need to let someone go, but laying off groups of people sounds like scapegoating management's bad decisions. Maybe they should be the first to go.
- [9 signs your frontend code has quality issues that affect your users | Angelika.me](https://angelika.me/2024/04/13/9-signs-your-frontend-code-has-quality-issues/)   
   100% valid accessibility concerns I don't want to see in a pull request.
- [Bill Gates, Man United and 20 other sites that ban linking to them](https://malcolmcoles.com/no-linking/comment-page-1/#comments)   
   I didn’t ask permission to link to this, oops
- [A Towering Acquisition](https://www.sfmoma.org/read/a-towering-acquisition/)   
   I really wish I knew this was in San Francisco before I moved. Nakagin Capsule Tower was one of the most stunning buildings you could see while entering Tokyo and I was puzzled why I didn't see it last year when I was in Japan. It is sad to hear it wasn't holding up well and needed to be demolished.
- [Apple Removes Nonconsensual AI Nude Apps Following 404 Media Investigation](https://www.404media.co/apple-removes-nonconsensual-ai-nude-apps-following-404-media-investigation/)   
   Uhh so what is an Apple-controlled App Store supposed to protect against if not apps like this?
- [The Man Who Killed Google Search](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/)   
   Spoiler: it’s the same man who killed Yahoo! Search, lol
- [Welcome to Chokeville](https://www.chokeville.com/welcome-to-chokeville/)   
   No one told me that Josh Fireland's Chokeville is back. I can't wait to dig in to this.  
- [Netflix is bringing back piracy](https://disconnect.blog/netflix-is-bringing-back-piracy/)   
   When each streaming service wants me and my parents to manage our own expensive accounts for their complicated apps, what choice do consumers have?
- [The Meat Grinder — Keenan](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/the-meat-grinder)   
   I'm late to this article, but it's an insightful look in to how things changed with the fruit company over time.  
- [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app/)   
   I'm excited to see EchoFeed launched! I'm using it for [@melkat](https://nyan.lol/@melkat) to share things that I write online.
