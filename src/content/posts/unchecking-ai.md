I've used [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) since January 2011, and I've bought the lifetime license every time they made a new one. I am a Legendary Mega Powerpack supporter, whatever that means. I have used this app heavily and have seen no point in stopping. Though Alfred hasn't been considered "cool" for a while now, it did what I needed and did it well. I don't need "cool"; I need something that works. When I upgraded to macOS Sequoia, Alfred could no longer successfully open apps most of the time. I assume the blame belongs to Apple. Alfred went from being my go-to app to wishing I had [Florence from The Jefferson's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEhw-ga4RGY). At least she would deny my request with a funny quip.

I have slowly seen Alfred's biggest proponents swap to that one cool new app people seem to like. I would always look at it, read about it, and then tell myself I don't want to spend $100 a year on it. Especially since the subscription includes AI. There's also a $200 per year plan with "Advanced AI, " whatever that means. It always sounded very hype-chasing and environment-killing. But I had to find something that worked since Alfred could no longer launch apps, so I figured I would try it.

It does what it needs to. I don't need to spend money on it for anything, to be honest. I installed some extensions from the "Store," and all the ones I tried have been pretty nice. However, many extensions are buggy with an ["Error: Worker terminated due to reaching memory limit: JS heap out of memory" issue](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues?q=Error%3A+Worker+terminated+due+to+reaching+memory+limit%3A+JS+heap+out+of+memory). The biggest upside is that all the AI bullshit can be toggled off with a checkbox. I guess I'm using this app now.

It is 2024, and the best I can hope for is a checkbox to turn off the AI garbage.
