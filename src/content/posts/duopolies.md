We need more options in life than evil versus slightly less evil. At best, we have two options for any given thing, and any attempt to add more options is met with "why aren't you supporting slightly less evil!" That's not a good motivator. This year alone, the number of times I've seen slightly less evil essentially just give up has been, well, disastrous at best. When slightly less evil gives up entirely, it only serves to promote and embolden evil. The duopoly is just a monopoly with the illusion of choice.
