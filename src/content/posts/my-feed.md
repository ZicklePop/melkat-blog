The other day I joked on Mastodon

> attempting to make a single feed of everything i post online. not for the public, but for my therapist. [(via)](https://nyan.lol/@zicklepop/112187986787165189)

and then I foolishly followed it up with

> ok i did it. it's only available as a jsonfeed because this is only for the real sickos. and my therapist. [(via)](https://nyan.lol/@zicklepop/112188564423006618)

which may or may not have been what inspired me to write about [the frustrations of working with RSS feeds](https://melkat.blog/p/embrace-jsonfeed).

It takes a collection of my posts from:

- [melkat.blog](https://melkat.blog) - my blog
- [ocs](https://melaniekat.com/ocs) - when I add new art to my oc gallery
- [@zicklepop@nyan.lol](https://nyan.lol/@zicklepop) - my mastodon posts
- [@links@nyan.lol](https://nyan.lol/@links) - my mastodon account where i post interesting links
- [@zicklepop@nyan.pics](https://nyan.pics/@zicklepop) - my pixelfed photos
- [status.lol](https://status.melanie.lol/) - status posts
- [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/zicklepop/) - movies that i have watched
- [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/zicklepop) - weekly wrap-ups of my listening history

And that's it. I don't really do anything else in public anymore, but I imagine I would add more if I did. This is super dorky, but a fun weekend project. You can find the JSON feed at [melaniekat.com/feed](https://melaniekat.com/feed)

I also wanted to make a visual representation of the feed. I don't know how to fit it in with the main content of my website yet, but you can see it at [melaniekat.com/timeline](https://melaniekat.com/timeline) as I continue to tweak it.
