I was reading [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/) earlier this year and something he said really resonated with me.

> A Letterboxd subscription costs me $20 year; in exchange for my money I’m given a handful of useful features, like notifications when a movie I want to see is added to a streaming service I subscribe to. (And, yes, I am also awarded a good-boy badge indicating that I am a paying customer.) But the real reason I pony up is for a quality beyond straightforward “utility,” a quality I usually refer to as “[Doesn’t Make Me Wish I Was Dead](https://maxread.substack.com/p/a-year-of-read-max).”

"[Why would anyone subscribe to a social media platform?](https://maxread.substack.com/p/why-would-anyone-subscribe-to-a-social)" by Max Read 

 I used Letterboxd when it first came out but [I deleted my account in 2019 to protest the site's decision to protect nazis](https://letterboxd.com/journal/inglourious/), for which they later apologized. So I recreated my account and I started watching movies, something I didn't do much of.

I ended up watching [150 films this year](https://letterboxd.com/zicklepop/year/2023/), with about a third of them being new [movies or series from 2023](https://letterboxd.com/zicklepop/films/year/2023/). As I went through them to see which ones I enjoyed the most, two stood out.


## Past Lives

I could talk about the story, but you would probably guess it was predictable, but it doesn't check any of the typical "childhood friends reunited" boxes. So I won't write about the plot, but you should really experience it for yourself.

Something I can mention, though, is how historically accurate the technology in this movie is. I thought it was really impressive how they made Facebook and Skype look like they did over a decade ago. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that put so much effort into bringing back apps from the past.


## Joe Pera Slow & Steady

I have to admit, before this was released, I wasn't the most familiar with Joe Pera's work. I didn't expect one of the best things I saw this year to be a full-length comedy special released for [free on YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=9_97zE4GRZk).

I love how a person only a few years older than me can so effortlessly play old without falling into bigotry or something annoying. If you told me that [Review Brah](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheReportOfTheWeek) was his son, I'd believe you.
