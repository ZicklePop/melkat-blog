I recently wrote about [my decade in San Francisco](https://melkat.blog/p/decade-in-sf). It's funny, I spent the decade prior to my decade here dreaming of moving to San Francisco. I didn't think I would ever leave this city (by choice, at least). I also never thought I would be homebound to my studio apartment for the last three years or so by a global pandemic.

When one talks about leaving San Francisco it's usually got some gross undertones of hating the unhoused or made up crime statistics. Sure our mayor isn't great but what else is new.

I saw an opportunity for something new and I'm taking it.
