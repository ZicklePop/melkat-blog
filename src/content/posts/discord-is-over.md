I remember around a decade ago when my #gamer coworker introduced me to Discord after attending the first TwitchCon. At the time, it was just a Slack clone with voice chat, and it looked like it, too. In 2017, I started using it heavily. It helped (and hurt) during the early days of my transition. I was [introduced to my wife](https://melkat.blog/p/first-three-years) through it. Hell, it played a huge part in our developing relationship. As everything started nose-diving to shit in 2020, it became a place I would go to keep up with the many _main characters_ of the internet (derogatory). It was more than just doomscrolling. It was a vice.

Discord was where I would go when I wanted hot gossip and schadenfreude. Sometimes, I would find the rare nugget of something cool happening, but let's be honest: I was there to find the rankest nuggets. It was addictive, and I kept coming back for more. Please give me my daily garbage, yum yum. My internet food pyramid became one giant triangle of trash. I mean, it wasn't just on Discord, but if I looked on Discord, I'd be ahead of the curve. Why did I need to know about garbage before everyone else? Why do I need to know about garbage at all?

I recently tried to clean up my Discord by focusing on things that bring me joy. Those areas broke down as the European Union started going after monopolies, something the USA is too cowardly to do. Then, the generative AI bubble began to grow. The mix of these two things activated the dormant libertarians. Won't somebody think of the trillion-dollar tech companies? They have it so rough.

Discord has never really had a way to make money, but for a while, they had a simple proposition: you give us a few bucks to stay afloat, and we give you a little extra. Then they raised the price. They tried to be a game store. They tried to get into cryptocurrency scams. Now, they want you to pay for micro-transactions for branded trash. They even had a failed buyout from Microsoft. Discord's corpse would have looked great next to the taxidermy trophies of Yammer, Skype, and GroupMe. Discord looks like it'll fall into the failing ad-supported privacy-invading model of everything else as it decays.

Hell, Discord joined other major social networks in using machine learning to assign you a gender. Facebook goes as far as to assign you a race. I'm Asian, according to Facebook. I forget what gender Twitter gave me. I corrected them by writing in my gender as "fuck you." The fascinating thing about Discord is that it does this periodically, so people noticed they can track their fluctuating gender over time (GOT) according to Discord's bad assumptions. Are you a Masculine May or a Femtober Ghoul?

This shit stinks. Both my actions and Discord the company's. I can't control companies, but I can quit and clean up my vices. More and more, I am happier offline and participating less with the internet.
