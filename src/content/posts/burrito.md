I believe it was Homer Simpsons who said it best: "Where's my burrito?" There is nothing more sacred than the relationship between someone and their burrito. If you're reading this then you are either casually reading my blog OR I linked this page to you so you could order me a perfect burrito. Either way, I thank you.

Everyone should have a [slashpage](https://slashpages.net) for their burrito order. Let's make it happen.

##  The Burrito

I'm from San Francisco, so I expected two things that might not be the norm: a steamed tortilla and that it be double-wrapped in foil.

- Meat: Carnitas
- Beans: Refried if available, pinto if not
- Salsa: Mild Pico de Gallo
- Rice: You bet
- Extras: Avocado slices if it will take a minute before I get around to eating it, like for delivery, otherwise I would love some guacamole

NorCal burrito best burritos, end of story.


## Breakfast Burrito

Hey good morning! It's hard to go wrong with a breakfast burrito. I love sausage, egg, cheese, bacon, and potatoes. Whatever checks off the most boxes is a win in my book.


## Taco Bell Burrito

Hey, we all love trash. I love trash. Yum yum give me garbage. I'll take a Beefy 5-Layer Burrito with seasoned beef, beans, cheese, nacho cheese sauce, no sour cream, and potatoes.


## To All The Burritos I've Loved Before

I no longer live in San Francisco, but here are some other kinds of burritos I have enjoyed from other restaurants.

- Sushirito's Sumo Crunch — a burrito made of shrimp tempura, surimi crab, cucumbers, red tempura flakes, spicy aioli, avocado spread, sushi rice, and nori
- Curry Up Now's Chicken Tikka Masala — a burrito made of Indian food. Personally, I would like to request no onions on mine but it's not a deal breaker.
