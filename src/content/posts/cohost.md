Last night, I wrote a joke on Mastodon that I thought was a funny roast of Cohost users in light of the website shutting down. It was only funny to me, so I deleted it. I understand that Cohost was of special interest to a very small and vulnerable group. That's kind of the problem, though, right? Cohost was a business, and you are a human being. Can I make it any more obvious?

This was the toot that I posted to followers only:

> #HeyCohost, don't forget to ask your parents for permission before going online.

Cohost was run very poorly from the get-go by some former techies who had no business running a business. How many business people do you know that debate the morality of CSAM? How is that a debate? That was my exit. I think this moment was the beginning of the end.

But Cohost's staff had spent years cultivating an audience online of vulnerable young queer people. Young queer people form communities everywhere: Facebook, Discord, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. Cohost wasn't your rock. The friends you made along the way were.

Cohost, a website by people in their 30s, wanted to be perceived as cool to young teens, and they have _very_ questionable views on CSAM. It is a bad look. It's worse that they spent much time begging their young, vulnerable audience for money while pocketing 90k a year.

No one was gloating to or putting down those people, but we were trying to warn you: Cohost is a sinking ship. The people who remained on Cohost put their fingers in their ears and acted like we were being mean. Websites come and go all the time. So, if Cohost was your first website to die on you, congratulations. It will happen again. And again.

Cohost lied through their teeth, claiming they would become sustainable by being a Patreon clone. Cohost blames Stripe's policies for their death, but that's silly. That's not how you operate a business. We also know that Stripe's policy changes had nothing to do with Cohost's decision to shut down.

What makes all of this worse is that Cohost grew in the death of Twitter, so we should have all known not to put our trust in platforms. The web is a vast place, and there are more than three websites. You can even have your own website, and no I'm not talking about a Linktree or Carrd. Is it hard? No. Does it cost money? Also no. You learned CSS for Cohost. You're ready for a website of your own. You can do it. I believe in you.

I've seen some Cohost users call Mastodon a "vile" place, and well, did you not see the harassment campaigns on Cohost? Probably not, because discovery on Cohost was bad. The moderators there were also very bad at moderating it, asking victims to beg their harasser's forgiveness in some documented cases. Mastodon has much better moderation tools for individuals and admins. Most people who run a server would go out of their way to defend you from attacks. I have a zero-tolerance policy with my server. Maybe it takes a minute to find your space, but you will, Mastodon or not.

But I am sorry you lost your special website.
