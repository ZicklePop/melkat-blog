This is the first home screen post with iOS 18! You can read about [my initial impressions](https://melkat.blog/p/ios-18-beta). I stand by my remark about the tinted icons: this is silly and I'm going to use it exclusively to anger the design gods. Let's get in to it, shall we?

What's different:

- [Airshow](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airshow-lightweight-podcasts/id1584582270) - I can't believe this is the first appearance of Airshow, the best podcast app.
- [Mona](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653) - A Mastodon app you can overly customize to the extreme
- [Panels](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/panels-comic-reader/id1236567663) - A very nice comic reader
- [Prompt 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prompt-3/id1594420480) - This app has some frustrating UX issues, but it's a pretty solid app for SSH-ing.
- [Readwise Reader](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/readwise-reader/id1567599761) - It looks like Readwise has added two key things since I was using it when it came out: stability and an option to turn off the AI nonsense. I don't think the option to turn off AI goes far enough, but it has [chilled a little](https://melkat.blog/p/read-later-chill-never).
- Pixelfed (beta) - My photo sharing platform of choice. [Follow me!](https://nyan.pics/@zicklepop)

iPad wallpaper is a blurred version of Wallaroo's Pride 2024 trans flag wallpaper. Without the blur, it is just too busy with the woven texture.
