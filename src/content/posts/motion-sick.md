I play a lot of games of all kinds, and even games that are in first person. Some games however are unplayable for me because they make me motion sick. It's not often I find a game like this, but it happens. They are also some of my wife's favorite games.

Here's a list off the top of my head:

- Doom (1993)
- Doom (2016)
- Fallout 3*
- Fallout 4
- Half-Life*
- Half-Life 2*
- Marathon
- Mirrors Edge*
- Oblivion*
- Skyrim*
- Wolfenstein: Youngblood
- â€¦[any VR game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_sickness#Individual_differences_in_susceptibility) after 15 minutes
- not a game but any [simulator ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulator_ride) (like Back to the Future: The Ride or it's replacement The Simpsons Ride)

Asterisks (*) denote that I did finish the game, at great physical expense to myself. Some of these I just pushed through telling myself that one long headache was better than a bunch of small ones. I don't know if that logic is sound. Some I did play in chunks of "how long until I start feeling sick." I don't know that I would put in that effort anymore, though.

We can clearly see there are two developers/publishers here who have a track record for making me sick: Valve and Bethesda (including their subsidiaries like id Software and Machine Games). They have been making games for a long time! Why are they like this so much that they are dedicated to whatever it is they are doing specifically to make people motion sick after decades? I don't know. I wish it was a bigger deal. How a game as big as some of these can come out and the media does not report that they too have these issues is odd.

Something I appreciate about some VR game stores is that they list (dis)comfort levels but unfortunately anything but "comfortable" is a rating I cannot tolerate.
