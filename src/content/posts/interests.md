These are current as to the moment I post this and forget to keep it updated. That said, I'm trying to go with things I have longer term strong feelings about, instead of something that might have recency bias. If anything sounds classic, cliched, or basic: sorry. I feel like some answers are so generic that it's weird to list them, but I'm going to. Maybe you should read in to what I don't list, lol.

Let me also preface this with: nothing is without criticism, and I am pretty quick to critique things I like. As a child of the 90's and the early internet I've been exposed to _a lot_ and I've spent my adult life trying to be better. I hate that "death of the author" nonsense. That's not how the creative process works. This list is just as much apart of me as the media listed here is the people who made it.

I also don't like to discriminate between types of work. Just because something is digital doesn't make it worse than something that is physical. Just because a book has visual art doesn't mean it is better or worse than a book consisting entirely of prose. So if you're going to be upset that I mixed anime and classic American sitcoms or books with comics and manga I don't know what to tell you. I also mixed Japanese arcade games with _""regular""_ games. Get mad, nerds.


## Music

Growing up I was big in to Blink-182 and other punk bands (no, i will not prefix it with 'pop' nor will I suffix it with 'rock') and that led me to all the different kinds of ska music. Third-wave best wave. I love how 100 gecs incorporates all of that in to their hyper pop. I feel like I'm hearing something totally new, but that feels familiar.

## TV and Film

Growing up I watched a lot of Nickelodeon and TV Land, which played 50's through 80's shows at the time. I got heavily in to anime in my mid 20's. I knew about anime as a teen, but it wasn't something that I could just "get in to" like it is now.

## Games

When I think about my history with gaming there was the early 90s where I played one game per gaming device. On Sega Genesis it was Sonic the Hedgehog, on Game Boy it was Links Awakening. Then Pokémon dropped and that was all I wanted to play until I got hooked on the internet.

## Reads

This section feels abnormally small for something I love to do, so let's say I'm still working on it. I didn't know much about comics growing up so that was something I fell into in my early 20's, and manga in my mid 20's. I read books off and on as a kid. I loved The Hobbit so much, then I got in to Lord of the Rings but my school stopped me from getting to read to the end of The Two Towers. It was the 90's and early 00's and satanic panic was still popular where I grew up.

## Locations

My dream growing up was to live in San Francisco and when I was 22 I was fortunate enough to take the plunge. I was scraping by OK, but I didn't get to really go on my own trips until I was 27 and visiting Japan changed my life. Cliche? Yeah probably. But do I truly believe this? Oh yeah.

After 12 years in San Francisco I've just decided to move to Portland. It's new to me, but my wife and I are loving it.

## Food

Growing up I was a very picky eater. Luckily moving to San Francisco meant I had to break that habit and try new things and now I will eat just about anything. I'm not a wasabi person. I try but after a while my sinuses start to hurt. I don't hate spicy foods, but my pathetic stomach does. I hate your guts, stomach.
