It was the last day of 1999, and my mother surprised me with an upgrade to my Sega Genesis, a translucent lime green Nintendo 64 with Donkey Kong 64. Sorry, it was "Jungle Green." I loved Nickelodeon slime green, so this was perfect. I got to learn the DK rap. I liked Donkey Kong 64 at the time, but Donkey Kong 64 is not a good game. Looking back, I'm surprised I got as far in the game as I did. Whenever I had a friend over, I would ask them to help me progress.

At the same time, Sega struggled to get people to pay attention to their new Dreamcast. The only time I remember seeing one was at a Sears demo kiosk. Then, I never really thought about it again until I met my wife. Her favorite game is Rayman 2, and her favorite platform to play it on is the Dreamcast version. She sent me everything I needed to play it, and for a few weeks, we would video call before I went to work, and she would watch me play Rayman 2 for Dreamcast. Neither of us ever had a Dreamcast.

My wife got accepted to show off her game at the recent Portland Retro Gaming Expo. As she worked the booth, I was wandering the show floor. When I am in a big store and don't have anything specific to do, I challenge myself to find a needle in a haystack. I do this in Japanese stores where I try to find a specific book or album. I call this hard mode because I can't read Kanji. Finding my wife's favorite game for a retro console at a retro gaming expo should be doable.

Well, it almost wasn't. I wasn't looking for a specific language of the game. English or Japanese would be fine. Even at retro gaming expos, the Dreamcast is not very popular. I only found one place with a copy of Rayman 2 for Dreamcast, and it was in English. Unfortunately, it cost more than I would have liked at $54. I don't know what a reasonable price for it is. I know these people are trying to sell Pok√©mon Crystal for the Game Boy Color for upwards of $300. C'mon.

My wife was surprised, but I quickly realized this wasn't just a symbolic gift; she would need a Dreamcast. They aren't that expensive compared to the games. My friend Erik warned me that I might need to do a power supply mod if it overheats, and modding it is generally easy.

We only had Rayman 2. That's all my wife needs. But we got a whole Dreamcast, so what else can this thing do? Well, most Dreamcast models do not have an effective method of copy protection, and you can burn games to a CD-R. (Remember CD-R's? They're like CD-RW's but without a W.) Do I even have a CD burner? I think I have a USB Blu-ray drive that is a burner. I haven't done this in forever! Can they also burn CDs? Turns out: yes.

In the age of burning CDs, I often heard people talk about the best brand of burnable CDs being Verbatim. I never had access to those in my part of the country. But now, for less than half of a secondhand copy of Rayman 2 for Dreamcast, I could buy 100 CDs. Sounds good, right? Well, it turns out, as with everything, someone bought the Verbatim brand and turned it into shit. I swear half of these discs are visibly not functional. It's no big deal. We're happy just burning discs and seeing if they work in the Dreamcast. Now, we have a handful of other games to play.

Overall, it's fun playing a Dreamcast with my game developer wife because she can point out all the technically impressive things that it can do that not even modern consoles can do or features that were ahead of their time. I'm no expert, but I can tell the frame rate is excellent.

We aren't done yet. We have an SD card mod on the way, and my wife is on her way to 100% Rayman 2 again, but this time, it's on the actual hardware.
