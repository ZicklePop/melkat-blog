Welcome back to Here's Some Links. I feel like I just did one of these, but the links keep coming so here we are again. This time around we got some cool stuff my wife worked on, a remade Hatsune Miku music video, more Cohost criticism, why your favorite mobile app stops getting updates, and some insecure technology. Oh yeah, don't let your job kill you. You are more valuable than a corporation. I will continue to yell "people over companies" until people stop valuing companies over people.

- [Portland Retro Gaming Expo 2024: A Post-Mortem - Blog of The Enby Witch](https://blog.of.the.enbywit.ch/blog/prge2024/)  
   My wife wrote about her big day showing off her game at an event!
- [BUG BALL by dapper_dinosaur](https://dapper-dinosaur.itch.io/bug-ball)  
   My wife made the titular bug model in this game!
- [HACHI - DONUT HOLE 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7fu_nNQAEQ)  
   I love this new version of DONUT HOLE. Very fun animation.
- [Cohost: A somber, yet predictable end - Seafoam Gaming](https://seafoamgaming.com/2024/09/24/cohost-a-somber-yet-predictable-end/)  
   A very happy “that site that stole rent money from poor queer kids” is shutting down day.
- [Despite Federal Protections, LGBTQ+ People Are Being Mistreated at Work - them.us](https://www.them.us/story/lgbtq-people-mistreated-workplace-federal-protections-williams-institute-survey)  
   Yup.
- [Our Android App is Frozen in Carbonite - iA Writer](https://ia.net/topics/our-android-app-is-frozen-in-carbonite)  
   All app stores suck. They burn out developers so less people can make apps.
- [Don’t ever hand your phone to the cops - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252235/police-unlock-phone-password-face-id-apple-wallet-id)  
   Digital IDs sound cool but you know what else is cool? Plastic cards that don’t carry your entire life inside them.
- [Work is meaningless, and it almost killed my husband - Salma Alam-Naylor](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/work-is-meaningless/)  
   Out of all the ways to go, working should not be on the list.
- [Disable Sequoia's monthly screen recording permission prompt - TinyApps](https://tinyapps.org/blog/202409180700_disable_sequoia_nag.html)  
   Turning off Apple’s annoying security prompts is exactly like cheating in Animal Crossing, begging the question: is this actually protecting anybody? (no)
- [gaining access to anyones browser without them even visiting a website - eva's site](https://kibty.town/blog/arc/)  
   TLDR: the Arc web browser has no security, may not even know the definition of the word probably because their AI hallucinated it to them.
