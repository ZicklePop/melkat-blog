I've avoided making a [slashpage](https://slashpages.net) for my default apps for a while because my ideal goal is to not need very many apps. My other goals are: avoid subscriptions, avoid ads, and avoid scammy fads. And honestly, I want to avoid hardware lock-in with apps that only run on one OS, but I've failed at that. So here are my current default apps, complete with markers for the ones that are thin ice that I would prefer to not use.
