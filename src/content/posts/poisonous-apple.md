Apple has long been posterizing that they care about diversity and the environment, but their actions have never backed it up. They might put up a black and white photo of Ghandi with some clichéd text next to it, but it has only ever been about _The Brand_. This article from 404 Media gets in to the latest news about Apple's violations, but this isn't the first time we've heard about this. You see, it has been public knowledge that Apple has been poisoning the environment and their employees since 2021.

At the same time, Gjøvik was dealing with a huge amount of sexism and retaliation, as documented by The Verge in, "[Apple places female engineering program manager on administrative leave after tweeting about sexism in the office](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610112/apple-female-engineering-manager-leave-sexism-work-environment)". You can also read more about the retaliation she faced from Apple for trying to speak up about all of this in The Verge's other article, "[Apple cares about privacy, unless you work at Apple](https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id)", where it was revealed that all Apple employees had to connect their personal iCloud data to their work data, where they would be mixed. This led to Apple's lawyers collecting nude photos from their employees against their will.

> A member of the legal team responded that while the lawyers did not need to access Gjøvik's photos, they did not want her to delete any messages. During an in-person meeting, Gjøvik says she told the lawyers the messages included nude photos she'd sent to a man she was dating -- a sushi chef who lived in Hawaii. Surely, those weren't relevant to the lawsuit. Could she delete them? She says the lawyers told her no.

The amount of shit Gjøvik has had to go through just for trying to do her job is absurd. She tried to make the place better through the proper channels behind closed doors and was retaliated against for doing so. She was also retaliated against for talking to the National Labor Relations Board, you know, the people you talk to when your boss is retaliating against you. Tim Cook responded to her complaint to the NLRB with a company-wide email.

My dude, she leaked that you were punishing and retaliating against her for speaking out against sexism and OSHA violations. The correct action would be to hear her out and try to make things right instead of intentionally breaking the law. This wasn't a product leak, this was a leak of a company abusing their employees.

_(Tim Robinson voice)_ **YOU CANT DO THAT**

In January 2023, the NLRB found that Apple's NDAs and employee policies are unlawful, as reported by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-30/apple-executives-violated-worker-rights-us-labor-officials-say).

So back to the 404 Media article that is [based on a Mastodon thread by Gjøvik](https://mastodon.social/@ashleygjovik/112668309100333232) where she mentions that the Environmental Protection Agency inspected a building in August 2023, two years after the initial report of OSHA violations, and found [19 potential violations](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/312oqvretg7yyhfx0ohx4/AGZduVXs0_1geqIyi0NA9nE?rlkey=3aa2tw15ek3trqlbdh7pw9erh&e=1&st=e7pg1cpp&dl=0). Two years later! At least Walter White knew to move his illegal chemical activities so his brother-in-law wouldn't catch him. Three years after it almost killed Gjøvik.

> The inspection was supposed to be unannounced so EPA surprises the inspected party who has no chance to cover up issues before EPA gets inside. However city HazMat tipped off Apple & EPA was greeted by Apple's EH&S team. Note: what EPA found was AFTER Apple had time to clean up.

Apple was even tipped off to the surprise inspection. I have to wonder if they even tried to destroy any evidence, if so they did a very bad job of it. They were even inspected again in January 2024, this year. If I were being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice for being an unfair monopoly, I'd simply not be an unfair monopoly. But if I absolutely had to be a monopoly, I'd at least try to make it less obvious, but I guess that's what the words on the photo of Ghandi meant by "Think Different."
