title: That site you use is dead

Since November 2022, people have been creating these long convoluted guides to figure out how to keep using a toxic and hostile social media site. It's funny, because Twitter has been considered confusing and convoluted since its inception: "why would anyone use that?" "so you tell people when you eat a sandwich?" and "I don't get it." Simply put, Twitter never really took off outside of some passionate clout chasers and bots. Even after it died that November, it hasn't stopped some people with some very unhealthy habits from trying to resuscitate a dead bird.

Cut to this week when Google announced that they were getting rid of web search. Now when you search, it will make up some random bullshit with "AI." But once again, people have started creating convoluted guides and hacks to keep using Google to search the web.

Are we not tired yet? Just like how nobody needs Twitter, nobody needs Google. A better web does exist.
