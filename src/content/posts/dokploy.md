I've been watching Dokploy for a bit now and it has been maturing pretty fast. I have it running on a Raspberry Pi 5 at home and I love how easy it's getting to deploy almost anything. It has templates for commonly used self-hosted apps, which are fun to play with. I can see getting a VPS and using this outside my local network eventually.
