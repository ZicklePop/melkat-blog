title: Webkit isn't the problem, Safari is
tags: [post, tech]

Someone who works on Webkit was recently asking for a list of websites that work in every other browser but Safari. I don't know that this is the biggest problem with Safari. I think the problem is, as is with everything Apple: the yearly release cycle.

In theory this should be great: give the developers time to ship a solid bug-free product. In practice it means bugs that ship with the big yearly update stick around for the next year. Sure, we get the occasional minor feature release, but we don't see them in a timely fashion and they always feel like they introduce the new bugs we will have to live with.

This year alone we saw a major change to Safari: the removal of support for progressive web apps for people who are currently located in Europe. This was a huge change that Apple spent precious engineering hours on. This wasn't to help the web, this was to help Apple's monopoly and punish the European Union for dare trying to rein them in. When the European Union called them out on this, they then had to once again take their engineer's time to revert and pull out what, I have to assume, is geolocation DRM spaghetti code.

The Safari we got in the mean time is one that stops working multiple times a day. Sometimes pages stop loading entirely until you reboot your entire device. Sometimes extensions work only once before you have to force quit Safari to get them to work again. This is doubly odd because Apple loves to say force quitting apps on iOS doesn't do anything.

Could this time be better spent keeping up with W3C specs? Maintaining compatibility with other browsers? Shipping bug fixes? Obviously not, according to Apple.
