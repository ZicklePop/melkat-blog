On Sunday I dropped an indie web service provider for not seeing eye to eye on if trans and nonbinary people deserve to be visible in the world. I did it fairly quietly and without making a big deal out of it. What is there to debate about my identity? Nothing. I'll take my content and go. It wasn't my first time, and it won't be the last time I have to do this.

Hell, it wasn't even the first time _in the last 30 days._

Hell, it _wasn't even the 2nd time this year!_

The provider noticed this and started raging online that I was trying to cancel them. This also came after I spent a week building open source tools for their product in my spare time for free. I deleted them. It was a major disappointment to me. I've used NPM forever now but had never come up with anything to publish on there. All of a sudden I had 4 published NPM packages. Now I have none.

The most unsettling part of this was their mentions full of cisgender white men, some I know from online, defending them, claiming I was being a jackass. I don't fault them for this, the provider didn't name me or any specifics at all, just that _someone_ was trying to cancel them. The only thing I canceled was my account.

I don't think transphobes deserve anonymity, but I also don't want to make matters worse. They have a small mob, I have a marginalized identity. I know where I stand.

None of this brought me any joy and it took a few hours away from my Sunday. My anxiety rose when I got back to my computer and saw the posts about me and an email from the provider in my inbox. I deleted the email without reading it. I don't need the drama. The evening was full of times that I would turn to my wife and say "they are still going on about me online." I made a delicious guac.

Thankfully a few people knew enough about what was going on to defend me. That was cool of them, and I appreciate it. I kept receiving emails from the provider and I kept deleting them. To their credit, they did refund every penny I had ever given them, which I did not ask for. But c'mon, let me enjoy my guac.

You might want to ask me what they could have done differently, and I understand that urge, but that's not my responsibility. Am I supposed to make like Pee-Wee Herman in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure when all the bikers are trying to think of ways to hurt him and he says, trying to throw his voice as if it's apart of the angry biker mob, "I say we let him go," to which the bikers immediately shout, "NO!"

As David Lynch's cameo character, FBI deputy director Gordon Cole, in Twin Peaks: The Return says to the trans character on the show, "When you became Denise, I told all of your colleagues, those clown comics, to _fix their hearts or die_."
