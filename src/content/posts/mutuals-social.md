Only Mutuals. That was the joke I couldn't get out of my head. So I decided to make a website that only my mutual followers could access. Nothing risqu√©, just things for my friends: like the wallpapers I used to design and so on.

While I had been playing with the Mastodon API, I had not been playing with the authenticated part. So I built an application that authenticates you with your Mastodon server and then checks to see if you are following [me](https://nyan.lol/@zicklepop) and if I am following you back. Nothing too fancy.
