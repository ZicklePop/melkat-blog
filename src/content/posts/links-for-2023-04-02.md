Here's what I've enjoyed over the last few weeks. These will continue to be a little all over the place, but that is just a reflection of who I am.

- [Why Japan’s Northern Dialects are Shorthand for “Hick”](https://youtu.be/hIOT-Zkf9Qo)   
   That's a lot of Japanese dialects to keep track of!  
- [‎Arc | Mobile Companion](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arc-mobile-companion/id1669785846)   
   I absolutely love the Arc browser on Mac, so yes I am very excited for their iOS app

   "We won't spy on you having sex like they do over at Electronic Arts" is a pretty unique selling point for a game

   Don’t forget you are now free to disparage your former employers. I’ll go first: every one of my former CEOs smelled like butts. Stinky butts.  
- [Remember When Microsoft Lied to Us?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuGrbQq2lAk)   
   Why does Microsoft needs to spend all that money on OpenAI when they were doing all this stuff back in 2009 with Project Natal and Milo. lol.  
- [Web fingerprinting is worse than I thought - Bitestring's Blog](https://www.bitestring.com/posts/2023-03-19-web-fingerprinting-is-worse-than-I-thought.html)   
   Right now Firefox is the only browser where you can turn off the new methods being tracked online with fingerprinting and it's not on by default. (It may break some websites? I haven't had any trouble yet.)  
- [The Case For Shunning](https://armoxon.substack.com/p/the-case-for-shunning)   
   Damn I wish these people were being silenced, then I wouldn't have to hear their bigoted tirades anymore.
