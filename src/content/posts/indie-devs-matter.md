Apple has made a lot of partnerships with big companies like Quantum Computer Services (AOL), Microsoft, HP, Intel, Cingular (AT&T), Epic Games, Valve, Capcom, and Ubisoft. They are all pretty one-sided in terms of who benefits. Focusing on these partnerships distracts from what has made Apple's platforms  successful: the community of dedicated indie developers. But like their corporate partnerships, this relationship is not a healthy one.

People love to talk about how good Apple's hardware is and how its software ties it all together, but that doesn't feel true anymore, does it? We have M4 iPad Pros that are less capable than the PowerPC Mac was. I can run a software-emulated Windows XP virtual machine on my M2 iPad Pro and do more with it than just using iPadOS. No, it's not Apple that keeps Apple's platforms afloat, it's the indie developers.

So what does a macOS or iOS look like without indie developers? A bad time, that's what. I've been pretty deep into the Apple ecosystem since I was in high school, and somehow I went from having an iPhone to having an iPhone and a handful of Android devices. I went from having a MacBook to also having a few handheld Linux gaming machines and a Windows PC for gaming. And you know what? They're all great.

I don't know who needs to hear this but Linux, Windows, and Android are fine! And typically 1/10th the price. My Android-based VR headset was 1/10th the price of a Vision Pro. My Android phone-minus-cellular device was 1/10th the price of my iPhone. My gaming PC was... about the same price as a Mac, but it can easily run games over 60fps with ease, which no amount of money would get me from Apple.

So if the devices are better value, why do we still hold on to our Apple devices? Because that's where the dedicated indie app scene is. Apple holds them to a high standard. Remember when Apple famously [allowed Uber to install spyware](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/23/15399438/apple-uber-app-store-fingerprint-program-tim-cook-travis-kalanick) in their app, that [they used to stalk reporters](https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/19/7245447/uber-allegedly-tracked-journalist-with-internal-tool-called-god-view), and gave them a slap on the wrist? Indie devs don't get that kind of treatment from Apple. They have to have everything perfect when they submit their app or it will be rejected. Even then, it can still get rejected. Even then, Apple can [close their account](https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/15v5avk/apple_id_disactivated_for_no_reason/) with no reason given and no way to reactivate it.

With all this in mind, what reason do indie app developers have to make their apps exclusive to Apple products? They pay for the privilege of being a selling point for Apple's hardware. They bend over backwards to hit goalposts that big tech doesn't have to hit. Not even Apple lives up to their high standards. Indie app development for Apple devices is a gamble. While it's easier to make cross-platform apps these days, it's also a huge pain to go through all those "app store" submission processes. It was harder for me to distribute my apps than it was to code them. It's a painful process that can take weeks just to release a new version, but it's worth it to me to be everywhere a user wants to be rather than to force a user to use my specific platform.
