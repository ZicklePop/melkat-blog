I'm trying to get better at bookmarking and categorizing things so I can find them later. In the process, I've started posting the links I'm excited about to Mastodon from time to time, and now I'm collecting some of them here.

- [Peacock’s all in for Poker Face season 2](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23601139/poker-face-season-2-peacock)   
   More Poker Face!!! More Natasha Lyonne!!!
- [Bachelor parties suck so bad](https://www.welcometohellworld.com/bachelor-parties-suck-so-bad/)

- [初音ミク×よみうりランド2023　～初音ミク16周年記念～　開催決定！ – 初音ミク公式ブログ](https://blog.piapro.net/2023/02/mk232101.html)   
     I am really jealous I wont be able to attend this year's Miku × Yomiuri Land collab. I was able to attend one a few years ago and it was *so* cool. MIKU WITH A SEA LION!!!
- [Don't Get In The Kiln](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2onuBxhafg)   
   If you haven't seen Aunty Donna's comedy before you should fix that
- [The case for frameworks](https://seldo.com/posts/the_case_for_frameworks/)   
   "The case for frameworks", a rebuttal to an angry guy online who calls people "stupid" for growing as developers over time, especially for using ReactJS. The original piece feels like one of those tongue-in-cheek "they played us for fools" memes without the sense of irony.
- [Hatsune Miku Global Concert “HATSUNE MIKU EXPO 2023 VR”](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cryptonfuturemedia/hatsune-miku-global-concert-hatsune-miku-expo-2023-vr)   
   New Hatsune Miku (online) Expo Kickstarter just dropped!! 
- [An investment in future virality](https://www.garbageday.email/p/an-investment-in-future-virality)   
   Read from the start for a good piece on the hell that is Mr. Beast
