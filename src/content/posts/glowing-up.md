**Warning**: Light spoilers for the movie "I Saw the TV Glow." Keep reading only if you need convincing to see the movie or have already seen it.

Last night I watched "I Saw the TV Glow" by Jane Schoenbrun for the first time. I'm not sure my head is even done processing it, but I want to talk about how much I related to it. From growing up on the couch, to watching Nickelodeon exclusively, to discovering who I was the whole time in my late 20s.

Yes, this is an A24 horror film and I would agree that it is horror, but it doesn't have jump scares or gore. In fact, if you aren't queer I don't know that you would find it scary at all. You need to pick up on queer narratives and have empathy for them. I'm not saying this film is "difficult" but I am saying I checked a couple of boxes that I have to assume helped connect me to it.

> "I… I… I think that… I like TV shows."

The movie follows two kids who gather to watch The Pink Opaque. Growing up with the young adult network, I loved shows like Clarissa Explains it All, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Allen Strange, The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo, and even the Animorphs TV show. There was one show that messed me up quite a bit and I would race to change the channel every time it came on: Are You Afraid of the Dark. I don't think The Pink Opaque is supposed to be any single show, but you can definitely see the inspirations from Nickelodeon's 90's live-action shows.

I didn't really have friends who also watched these shows. When I was about to start school my family moved from a small town with Nickelodeon to a smaller town without Nickelodeon. My parents and I argue about how long it took them to restore my access to Nickelodeon by getting satellite TV. I think it took from 6 months to a year. They say it was immediate. I know that wasn't the case.

During that dark time in my life, I watched things like... The Weather Channel and Home Shopping Network. You know, for fun, like kids do. Although, once we had satellite, any little bit of rain would cause it to cut out. And because we had satellite, it meant that my classmates and I were watching a different set of TV stations.

The most important part of Nickelodeon, especially looking back, was that its goal was to teach kids to be kids. It meant teaching them that it was OK to be "weird" or "wild & crazy." It also taught me that if I dig around in a human-sized slimy nose long enough I would find the red flag and win a big prize like a Zenith TV. But most importantly, it taught me that being unique and different was something to be celebrated, to be proud of.

I had VHS tapes of Nickelodeon shows my mom would record herself or get one of her friends to record for me. I watched them all the time. My dad liked to drive a van while he worked, so he had a little 6-inch CRT TV with a built-in VHS player that he tied down to the floor behind the driver's seat. He took the middle seat out of his van and I could sit on the back seat and watch Rugrats while he drove around the state. My parents taught me time by measuring roughly 15 minute intervals as "1 Rugrats." They would tell me where we were going was "2 Rugrats" away.

> "Isn't that a show for girls?"

I knew who I wanted to be growing up. I wanted to be like Alex Mack and go on adventures. I wanted to be able to transform in to something else like on the Animorphs. I wanted to make things on computers like Clarissa Explains It All. I never understood what the deeper thing at play here was. Well, I did, but I was told it wasn't possible to be a girl, so I put out of my mind.

At school I was weird. I was weird amongst other kids who hadn't been told being different is OK. My mom pulled me out of public school in the middle of 4th grade. Whatever friends I had made had started to fade. It was at this point too my mother let me sit down on the internet for long periods of time. I didn't need other kids who thought I was weird, I had Neopets. The website that would teach me how to make websites and led me to a career in _Front-End Engineering_.

My memories of being a kid are basically all Nickelodeon shows in some form. I look back fondly on them. In my late teens I found a way to revisit some of these shows through [publicly available internet data](https://nyan.lol/@zicklepop/112609986890748740). They didn't hold up to what I had felt watching them as a kid. It disappointed me quite a bit.

> "I know it's scary. That's part of it."

Most of the things I've mentioned have an obvious connection that a very specific type of shithead would make quickly in order to try to shame me. You see, I couldn't have the girlhood I desired, but I got to experience it through the media I consumed. Is it the same? No, but it's what I had available and it felt safe.

My parents and I both have grown a lot since I was a kid and I'm thankful for it. Growing up I would alternate which of them I felt more scared of. It wasn't a good use of either of our time. Now I want to hold on to the time I have left with both of them. I'm so happy to be where I am today.

Now then, if you need me I'll be out looking for a Fruitopia machine to feed a dollar to.
