I got some links for you on this lovely Friday the 13th.  This one contains commentary on capitalism, why Cohost was never that great a place, checking in on Substack's nazi problem a year later, stories about trans women in aerospace _and_ comedy, and some satire on genderless video game robots. Not in that order. I mean, unless you read things non-sequentially, which is a real thing I catch myself doing sometimes. Am I OK? Probably!

- [Data Piggy by fromjason](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/data-piggy/)   
   Oink oink, the data piggies need your content.
- [Cohost So White: A Comprehensive Record of the Matter of Race on Cohost by Alyaza Birze](https://alyaza.neocities.org/essays/Cohost/cohostsowhite)   
   Cohost was anything but a nice place.
- [I’m Worried The Robot in Astro Bot Isn’t Attractive Enough For Me To Enjoy](https://www.thegamer.com/astro-bot-robot-not-attractive-enough-stellar-blade/)   
   Just don’t make the robot a woman, men wouldn’t be able to relate.
- [The Moral Implications of Being a Moderately Successful Computer Scientist and a Woman by Irene Y. Zhang](https://www.sigops.org/2024/the-moral-implications-of-being-a-moderately-successful-computer-scientist-and-a-woman/)   
   This piece cannot be shared enough.
- [Substack's Nazi problem isn't going away](https://theracket.news/p/substacks-nazi-problem-isnt-going-away)   
   The biggest "history" newsletter on Substack is by an out and proud nazi, and Substack promotes it heavily to everyone.
- [Some thoughts on the YubiKey EUCLEAK Vulnerability by Terence Eden](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/09/some-thoughts-on-the-yubikey-eucleak-vulnerability/)   
   This isn’t a major problem today, but one to keep an eye on for sure.
- [A note on estimated reading times by Baldur Bjarnason](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/on-reading-time/)   
   I’ve been at "75 minutes remaining" of this book I’ve been reading the entire time I’ve been reading it and I’m now 75% of the way through.
- [Apple’s Huge “Dual Use” Face Swap App Problem Is Not Going Away from 404 Media](https://www.404media.co/apples-huge-dual-use-face-swap-app-problem-is-not-going-away/)   
   Apple thinks they need that 30% revenue cut on apps that make nonconsensual porn of underage women, so they won't stop selling them.
- [“Abusing you was by the book” by Nathalie Lawhead](http://www.nathalielawhead.com/candybox/abusing-you-was-by-the-book-documenting-two-years-of-abuse-from-game-journalism-after-sharing-my-metoo-the-whole-painful-story-all-in-one-place)   
   It sucks that the people who did this have been able to go about their careers without consequence.
- [Sometimes there are just too many words by JCProbably](https://notes.jeddacp.com/sometimes-there-are-just-too-many-words/)   
   Everyone wants you to move fast and not think about the consequences.
- [Timing: The Legacy of Korean Comics Artist Kang Full from Yattatachi](https://yattatachi.com/timing-kang-full)   
   Korean comics (manhwa) are having a moment!
- [suck my dick and balls i work for nasa: the naomi h story - Sixteenth Minute (of Fame)](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-sixteenth-minute-of-fame-172216473/episode/suck-my-dick-and-balls-i-198420059/)   
   Employers will look for any little reason they can find to avoid hiring someone. You know, like excitement. God forbid NASA hire someone who wanted to be there.
- [‘You are a helpful mail assistant,’ and other Apple Intelligence instructions from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213861/apple-intelligence-instructions-macos-15-1-sequoia-beta)   
   Telling your bullshit machine “Do not hallucinate” is some massive amounts of cringe.
- [Inside Apple Arcade (again): late payments, stonewalled studios, terrible tech support and Vision Pro woes from Mobilegamer.biz](https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-again-late-payments-stonewalled-studios-terrible-tech-support-and-vision-pro-woes/)   
   I wrote about how releasing software on an app store is harder than building apps. I suppose I wasn't being harsh enough.
- [Patti Harrison Is Ready to Take Control from Harpers Bazaar](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a61557787/patti-harrison-performance-portfolio-august-2024/)   
   I love Patti! Some of what she said feels relatable to coding at a tech company.
- [Exclusive: Taboola to sell ads for Apple from Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/16/taboola-apple-news-deal)   
  Is this pus-filled growth infected? Find out in Apple News.
- [Mozilla Welcomes Anonym: Privacy Preserving Digital Advertising](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-anonym-raising-the-bar-for-privacy-preserving-digital-advertising/)   
   "Privacy preserving" in that Mozilla will give their ad company privileged access to your data, I guess.
