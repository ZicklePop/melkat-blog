It was late 2020 when Apple started enforcing privacy nutrition labels on apps. At the time, your usual suspects bemoaned this change. It did have some issues that haven't been resolved around the vagueness of what these labels mean. Apple left it up for interpretation and self-reporting. So how do things stand now, nearly 4 years later?

I recently picked up [AppRaven](https://appraven.net) at [Lou](https://amerpie.lol) from [App Addict's recommendation](https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/appraven-apps-gone-free-and-more) and started making lists of the apps I use from the App Store.

My lists are a little out of date because I made it manually and I've made changes since then but if you're curious, here are those outdated lists:

- [whats on my mac](https://appraven.net/collection/91489020)
- [whats on my pad](https://appraven.net/collection/91329554)
- [whats on my phone](https://appraven.net/collection/91216989)
- [whats on my tv](https://appraven.net/collection/91488810)
- [whats on my watch](https://appraven.net/collection/91328880)

Now that I had these lists I decided to go through all of them by hand and dividing them in to four lists:

- Anonymous data collected, 72 apps - Not ideal, but not deal breakers
- Personal data collected, 58 apps - Hold on, what?
- Personal data collected for Tracking Purposes, 22 apps - Oh hell no, that's bad
- No details provided, 12 apps - I guess the app hasn't been updated since 2020?

I didn't note apps that I saw did not collect any data at all. Maybe I should have. While any app I noted is on the chopping block just for purely collecting data at all, the apps I want to get rid of entirely are the ones that are explicitly telling me in these labels that they are tracking me.

For the most part, Nintendo and Game Freak appear to try and avoid tracking. Nintendo Switch Online collects personal data, but "not for tracking purposes." Remember when I said this stuff gets vague? So is this Nintendo saying that they let me log in to my account? I have an account with 1Password, but they say they only collect anonymous data about me, so I don't think that's what collecting personal data means. The wild part of the Nintendo and Game Freak apps is that Pokemon Home, a subscription service that lets me pay $15 a year to back up my caught Pokemon in the cloud, claims to be actively tracking me based on my personal data.

It's really hard to draw any solid conclusions based on these labels, but if you're telling me you are tracking me, I have to believe it's as bad as you say, and I should delete their app.

It's not surprising, but it's no less disappointing that every app from Plex claims it is personally tracking me. Or that games like Minecraft and Vampire Survivors think it's OK to invade the privacy of the kids who play them. Or that Voice Tools by DevExtras, an app to help trans women overcome voice dysphoria, is invading the privacy of a highly targeted marginalized group. Or that Countdowns from Shayes Apps, an app that counts days, needs to track me at all.

If you're a developer reading this and are like, "but we need analytics to know if people are using our app," I would tell you that you don't. The App Store already provides enough data by default, and buggy apps are better than privacy invasion. I'm begging you to aim for "no data collected." It's not worth the harm to your users and if that doesn't matter to you, it also harms your brand.
