Everything wants to be a subscription service. That's not always a bad thing, but it does challenge me to try to limit the number of subscriptions I have and rely on things I'm already paying for rather than getting another service that does a similar thing.

I also want to avoid ads and "recommendations" in the apps I use. Very rarely can an app recommend something I would ever want. Usually a recommended thing is just something a company sees a lot of people like or something they want to push on people. This leads to getting bigoted things recommended. Rarely is there even a way to say "never recommend that bigot to me again". (Why do they even want to give bigots a platform?)

I think avoiding subs, ads, and recommendations is the main reason I use a lot of the apps I do. So, with that in mind, here are my _default apps_.


## The Basics

- **Bookmarks**: [Anybox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anybox-bookmark-read-later/id1593408455) - It synchronizes and archives links. That's all I need.
- **News**: [Reeder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reeder-5/id1529445840) with [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) - I've used Reeder and Feedbin for so long and they've both maintained their reliability.
- **Passwords**: [1Password](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id1511601750) and Apple Passwords - 1Password has more support and is everywhere, but for passwords I'll just use Apple's built-in password manager.
- **Podcasts**: [Airshow](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airshow-lightweight-podcasts/id1584582270) - I love an app that doesn't try to tell me what to do and stays out of my way.
- **Read later**: [Matter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/matter-read-listen-learn/id1501592184) - There's a bunch of read-later apps out there right now that are pretty good. What I am in to these days is a natural sounding text to speech feature.


## Tracking

- **Books**: [Book Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/book-tracker-tbr-bookshelf/id1491660771) - If we've learned anything in 2023, it's that social book-tracking sites should be avoided at all costs.
- **Flights**: [Flighty](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flighty-live-flight-tracker/id1358823008) - This app is way too expensive but no one else does the basics so well.
- **Movies**: [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) - Can social websites still be fun? I think Letterboxd is fun.
- **Music**: [QuietScrob](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quietscrob-last-fm-scrobbler/id741599377) - This little app does the best it can, I think, and scrobbles what I listen to in Apple Music over to Last.fm.
- **Packages**: [Parcel](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parcel-delivery-tracking/id375589283) - Incredibly cheap and supports lots of delivery services.


## Reading Stuff

I'm pretty simple. Some of them are subscription-based, but I find them incredibly cheap. I think Apple Books and Panels are great DRM-free content.

- **DRM-Free Books**: Apple Books and [Panels](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/panels-comic-reader/id1236567663)
- **Manga**: [Azuki](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/azuki-your-digital-manga-cafe/id1545075904), [Shonen Jump](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shonen-jump-manga-comics/id594237344), and [Viz Manga](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/viz-manga/id421486286)
- **Everything else**: [Kindle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-kindle/id302584613)


## Watching Stuff

- Apple TV - I use this to search all the other streaming apps and keep track of when new episodes come out.
- [Dropout](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dropout-by-collegehumor/id1380833056) - The best value in streaming.
- [Play](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190) - Make your own YouTube watchlist without all the YouTube stuff.
- [Plex](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plex-watch-live-tv-and-movies/id383457673) - Hell, make your own streaming service.
