I often recommend a lot of apps for different platforms to people, so I decided to catalogue them recently. I admins, it is a little much, lol, and I don't know how I'm going to keep it updated. I might not, but a lot of these apps have been with me for a long time.

I do want to comment on how I listed the prices: the cost to avoid subscriptions is what I listed. Some of these apps are free, and you may not need to pay for them, or you could pay less, but I thought it was important to set expectations up front.
