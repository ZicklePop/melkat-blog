title: The First Three Years of The Pandemic

I think it would be interesting to hear how others lived during the early days of the pandemic. I want to be clear: the pandemic is still here. It's still bad. We have more than one pandemic now. We as a society just don't care anymore, which is bad. I still wear a mask when I leave the house, despite no one around me but my wife doing the same. I still wash my hands constantly. I hope I'm not alone in doing that.

So to start we need to define the starting point on our X axis of a timeline, as Stephen Tobolowsky would say. I'm going to bullet point it so I don't spend too much time on it versus the actual first three years of the pandemic.

- April 2018: I started coming to terms with the fact I am a woman.
- September 11th 2018: I started taking hormones to help with that fact.
- November 1st 2018: I started presenting as a woman at work. Yes, the day after Halloween. The metaphor I was going for was that Halloween is over and I'm no longer going to wear this boy costume. Instead, some co-workers just thought I didn't know that Halloween was over.
- November 2019: I go on medical leave at work for a month due to extreme stress and burnout.
- January 2020: My dad comes to San Francisco for my 30th birthday.

Okay, so now we're up to the year 2020. Every time I see a date from January and February 2020, I instinctively say, "moments before disaster." We were so naive then. And young. We were much younger then. I wasn't thinking too much about COVID-19 until February. Closer to the end of February I was following it pretty closely: where it was, who had it, etc.

On March 2nd, 2020, I remember reading online where Steve Woz, once cool guy turned crypto loser/scammer, started [bragging online that he and his wife were "Patient Zero"](https://web.archive.org/web/20200319172428/https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/1234575727678435328) and that they were the ones who brought COVID-19 to the United States. I don't know why anyone would want to brag about this, claim this, and expect to not be instantly hated for it. I don't know if it's true, that seems like a big if, but the sheer fact that you would want to claim this is weird.

On March 5th, I read that COVID-19 had officially entered San Francisco, so I left work immediately before lunch. I got groceries and supplies. I wasn't hoarding, but I was making sure I would be able to last a few weeks or however long this would take. (lol)

I lived a studio apartment, roughly 400 square feet, in the Dogpatch of San Francisco. Just me and my cat. If you don't know the Dogpatch, there's not a lot there. A giant basketball stadium just opened a few blocks from me. There are some pricey restaurants, but it didn't have a grocery store or pharmacy. I was using Amazon Fresh for groceries, ugh Amazon, and PillPack for my pills. Amazon acquired them after I started using them, also ugh. Where's government intervention when you need it? This would be a question all of us would have about basically everything very shortly.

I started buying N95 masks and nitrile gloves for when I needed to go downstairs in my apartment building. I wasn't messing around. When packages arrived, I would let the packages sit for a few days before opening them, just to be safe.

My coworkers wouldn't start working from home until another week later. My employer's chief people officer (a 7 figure method of saying head of human resources) at the time started sending out weekly announcements on Sunday nights. These emails were the most deranged things I have ever read. One of the first ones that they sent included the most damning thing I've ever heard from a company:

> Don't ask what (COMPANY NAME) can do for you. Ask what you can do for (COMPANY NAME)

They would then cut everyone's pay by around 20%, despite having just been purchased by a company for billions of dollars that they had previously told us during company-wide meetings was a very evil company. They had just purchased a huge new office building outside of the city where I wanted to work, which would increase my commute time by hours each way.

Because I was in the early days of my transition I had found community online in Discord servers and I had met so many great trans and nonbinary people all around the world. This was helpful because when you come out, you quickly feel the people in your offline world pull away. Either because they are scared of queer people or because they simply do not have the patience for your anxiety from discovering your new lens to view the world.

I'm being harder on myself than I would be towards other trans people because I know I made a lot of mistakes and I'm not trying to dismiss my accountability. Managing anxiety is a skill I am always learning. After all, as the great game changer Sam Reich says, "the only way to begin is by beginning."

Through this online community I met someone who would randomly message me one day to ask if I was dating anyone. I said no, and they took this as an opportunity to introduce me to a Polish game developer. It was May and I had been stuck at home for two whole months straight without leaving and it didn't seem like that was going to change anytime soon. So I humored this person and got to know a Polish game developer.

We started video calling a lot. This was new to me. I remember in the "moments before disaster" two of my younger friends wanted to FaceTime me and I found that incredibly awkward. Why would I want to be on video camera? I thought this might be a sign of an age gap forming between me and people slightly younger than me. But in this time of extreme isolation, it was comforting.

So when my job cut my pay and started being glib about their financial outlook in the wake of this global pandemic, I had some emotional support. I don't know why my job was so glib about things. They weren't reliant on anything in the physical world. Some tech companies were using this as an excuse to start doing mass layoffs though, which was concerning, and it would only get worse and hey, look where we are today: things are still artificially bad. So I started looking for work elsewhere.

I started a new job in July 2020. It was kinda similar, except they were optimistic and positive about things. They sent their employees the occasional care package, gave them monthly work-from-home stipends, which I used to pay my internet bill. I didn't take a single vacation day for almost two years.

My Polish game developer friend turned in to an internet girlfriend in September 2020. I was kinda nervous about that because we had never met and this could be anything. I was very conservative with my expectations.

The next year we would start getting vaccines. They were very hard to come by. They were limited to people who needed them the most but didn't want to get them because of some conspiracy theories spread by the worst people. Meanwhile, the people who wanted them, like me, couldn't get them, and the unused vaccines were going to waste because they have a very short shelf life. In May of 2021 I would finally have a chance to get a vaccine. I would just have to take a $100 Lyft ride to an Oakland arena's parking lot, over an hour away. I suited up with my mask and nitrile gloves. It was time to leave the apartment. I would have to do this again a month later to get the second dose. Just as far and just as expensive.

In 2021, companies kept trying to force the idea that the pandemic was over. It wasn't, but we got a lot of reports of companies like Apple firing disabled workers who had, before the pandemic, been allowed to work from home, but after the pandemic started firing them for not returning to an office they had never been asked to come to before. The employees who did come in were just spreading COVID around. You know, the same as they do this very day.

It was that May before I saw any of my family again in person. People who I had known in the San Francisco area were leaving. People called this "byte flight" and I called it a betrayal of my favorite city in the United States, San Francisco. I was loyal, so I stayed put with my expensive rent in an expensive city in a tiny studio apartment.

Since I was fully vaccinated and my internet girlfriend and I were only growing closer, I decided to finally take a vacation: two weeks in Poland over Halloween! Do I have a thing for Halloween? I don't know! But, I figured this would be a fun excuse to see a country I'd never visit otherwise. I also had a backup plan in case something went wrong and I needed to have my own accommodations. I knew where all the nearest hotels were. Trusting someone you met online is one thing, but also flying a 14 hour flight to a city in Poland during a horrible pandemic was also a risk and I didn't want to potentially hurt anyone. I wore a super tight N95 mask that pressed its metal nose fitting thing in to my skin the whole way. I'm taking this as seriously as possible at a time when I really shouldn't be traveling at all.

I had a good time in Poland. I got to see where my internet girlfriend lived, I got to finally kiss her, and I got to visit Warsaw as a little trip within a trip. I did get sick, but it wasn't COVID. Just another one of my silly sinus infections, thankfully.

The year 2022 started out pretty uneventful. My internet girlfriend quit her job and took another at a bigger game development studio in London. She went through the whole process of getting a VISA to the newly Brexit-ed country and then sleeping on a coworker's couch while trying to find a flat. I was also planning visiting her again for Halloween. She caught COVID a few weeks prior to my scheduled arrival because her new employer was making her to come in to a crowded office every day.

Thankfully she didn't have COVID anymore when I got there, but she was suffering from the effects of long COVID and had developed a cold. I once again got sick while visiting her. I caught the cold and spent my vacation in London combatting it.

I tried to visit an urgent care while there. I had already spent the previous weeks studying the British health care system to help my internet girlfriend. Learning another country's healthcare system is bad enough, let alone having to do it while sick. Here's what I learned: I don't want to hear British people complain about the American health care system.

I arrived at some Catholic-sounding doctor's office. I waited hours in a waiting room with tons of screaming kids. I hear I could have waited longer, but I finally got called back to speak with some sort of medical professional. He was incredibly unfriendly. I hadn't shaved in a few days, but because my passport had a gender marker with the letter F, he was obviously taking the piss out of this American trans woman. For example, I was asked repeatedly about my periods. I didn't feel safe. He kept telling me that there was no medicine he could give me. Typically when I get sick for long periods the only thing that helps is, unfortunately, antibiotics. According to this guy, that would only make me sicker. He dismissed me and I walked out. I don't know if I was supposed to pay, but given the experience I got out of there as fast as I could.

I flew home after being sick in the UK for 2 weeks, still sick. Another 11 hour flight with an uncomfortable N95 mask, and another sinus infection. When I got home, I got on a video call with a doctor who prescribed me… that's right, you guessed it, antibiotics! As soon as I got the prescription filled I started feeling better immediately.

All that said, the trip was good. I got to spend time with internet girlfriend, and while I knew it was in her plan, I didn't know that one night while we were both sick, that she would propose to me. I said yes, in between blowing chunks out of my nose. Very romantic.

I should say, while I was in the UK, my employer had decided it was the perfect time to have the company's first mass layoffs: the start of the 2022 holiday season. I asked my manager if my team was affected and they said they didn't know, but if I still had access to Slack in an hour, that would be a good sign. They never announced who was laid off, so I would find out over the next six months as people I needed to reach out to were marked as "deactivated" in Slack.

It's now 2023, and we're starting to see the effects of the layoffs. Layoffs are a net negative all around. They send a message to every employee: "You're next" and "Don't bother trying too hard, we'll just have layoffs again real soon." A lot of my coworkers would end up quitting over the next few months. Sometimes you're just happy to get to say goodbye.

I decided to make 2023 a big year for me after having a huge bout of depression in the wake of my employer's self-sabotaging and the sudden realization that I was 33 and I had spent the entirety of my 30s inside my 400 square foot studio apartment. I started taking daily walks through the neighborhood. A new park along the San Francisco Bay had opened in my neighborhood during all of this. They even made a little beach for it! It's a nice park. Go visit Crane Cove Park if you're in the Dogpatch.

It's not my story to tell but, but my internet girlfriend suddenly wasn't tied to the continent of Europe. We took this as a good time to get started planning a wedding at San Francisco's city hall. Since December 19th, 2023, I've been able to call my internet girlfriend my wife. I think that's a pretty good conclusion to three years of intense isolation, but thanks to her, it definitely wasn't a time of loneliness.
